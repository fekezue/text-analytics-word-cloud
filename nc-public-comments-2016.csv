"Please make sure that federally qualified health centers continue to receive adequate reimbursement and that there is no hospital led efforts to minimize those reimbursements throughout the process. As hospitals continue to purchase primary care practices, they are under more pressure to corner those Medicaid dollars, leaving a poor payer mix for FQHC's.",208989,21 Jun 2016 09:22:36

"The Medicaid reform proposal ignores some highly pertinent facts and is not in the best interest of our state. The format suggested will be cumbersome to formulate and will add layers of bureaucratic complexity to the Medicaid system in North Carolina.
This terribly divisive proposal ignores the fact that the NC Medicaid system is nationally recognized as doing well. It has over 90% of primary care and many specialists with support by nonprofit Community Care of NC which is a consortium of 14 nonprofit entities covering all 100 counties. It works with every hospital in NC, with thousands of private practicing physicians, with every county health department, with all 34 federally qualified health centers, and with all 27 rural health centers. CCNC is a model which numerous other states have tried to emulate.
While enrollment growth has generated an increase in total costs, the per capita cost of healthcare for Medicaid patients in NC has gone down since 2010. There was a 4% decrease in 2011, and by 2015 a greater than 8% reduction as compared with 2010. No Medicaid program in any other state has had such experience. In fact, no commercial insurance company nor any MCO can show such results. What is the logic of disrupting such a successful homegrown system with for-profit MCOs that will cost more and generate aggravations for the provider community?
Notable is that these cost savings under the current system have accrued through improved clinical outcomes for patients, resulting in less emergency department visits and less hospitalizations.
In recent 12 public hearings across the state over 100 physicians to speak expressed disapproval of the reform plan and spoke in support of CCNC. They also voiced serious concerns for having to deal with multiple entities within the Medicaid system to gain reimbursement for services delivered.
At these hearings were repeated pleas for NC to shrink the uninsured population by accepting the federal money that has been allocated to expand Medicaid in our state. To do so would help the economy in every county across NC, especially in the less affluent regions. It would generate jobs and be a huge boost to hospitals and safety net clinics.
NC has a model Medicaid system that has a proven track record for decreasing per capita costs that no other state nor any MCO can rival. Rather than scuttle it, pragmatic good sense calls for its expansion. Let's do what is best for the people of North Carolina.

"As an employee of a Western North Carolina Community Health Center and also a Certified Application Counselor, I see firsthand the lives impacted by North Carolina's rejection of Medicaid Expansion. This affects the health and well-being of real people, such as a 63 year old retiree on a fixed income - too low for ACA subsidies but categorically ineligible for Medicaid in NC; a mother making minimum wage, whose income turns out to be higher than North Carolina's ridiculously low limit for parents yet under 100% FPL so again, ineligible for ACA subsidies; or a chronically ill middle-aged man who finds it difficult to work as he has gout, cannot afford out-of pocket healthcare that could ease his pain, and therefore cannot work enough to qualify for subsidies on the exchange. These are just a sampling of the likely half of a million people who are unable to access healthcare and are suffering as a result of living in the Medicaid Gap.

As the federal agency enabled to review the NC medicaid reform proposal, I believe that you should make Medicaid Expansion a condition of any reform proposal. People who really need medical assistance, our most vulnerable, poverty-stricken populations, should have access to life-saving medical care.",209001,23 Jun 2016 09:07:22
"I strongly urge you to include Medicaid Expasion in North Carolina's Medicaid Reform package. One in five adults under 65 in our state are uninsured! I know people personally who are not insured, and it's because they cannot afford insurance. We will lose $25 billion dollars in Federal matching funds between 2016 and 2020 if we do not expand Medicaid this year. Why do we choose to throw those dollars away, lose jobs, and continue the cycle of poverty?",209005,24 Jun 2016 11:57:45
The Department of Social Services needs to be reformed before you even think about expanding Medicaid. Physicians need to have their fees increased in order to take on more patients,209009,24 Jun 2016 21:38:43
"Please do you job and respect and protect the health of all North Carolinians for some of the following reasons:
Here are some bullet points for the costs of not expanding Medicaid:
1 in 5 adults under 65 remains uninsured in NC (around 500,000)
Not expanding Medicaid is already hindering job creation and economic growth because NC is not capturing billions in federal matching dollars that would otherwise flow into the state economy to make expansion more affordable.
If NC does not expand Medicaid by 2016, $21 billion in federal matching funds will be lost between 2016 and 2020.
Statewide, about half the jobs not created would be in health care (hospitals and clinics); almost half would be in other sectors such as construction or retail and wholesale trade.
Small hospitals and clinics have had to close–particularly affecting rural poor.
Non-economic reasons to expand Medicaid:
When parents are insured, their children are more likely to be insured and they are better able to care for their children.
By not closing the gap, the cycle of poverty and sickness continues. Consequences of families falling into crisis because of a lack of health coverage and a medical crisis include foreclosures and evictions- having to make the decision to pay the rent or pay for much needed medication.",209013,25 Jun 2016 06:30:39

"I am an insurance professional in western North Carolina . The ACA was designed to include Medicaid expansion. Without it, rates for all persons in the state are increasing faster than if Medicaid had been expanded.

"I work as a behavioral health provider at an FQHC in Henderson County, NC. We serve a great number of uninsured patients who would potentially qualify for Medicaid if it were expanded in our state. In addition, my agency could provide many services that would benefit our patients if more had insurance. PLEASE EXPAND MEDICAID IN NORTH CAROLINA!!!",209037,27 Jun 2016 15:33:00
"The LME system is awful in NC. I have two sons with autism and a daughter with mental illness. My one son has been on the waiting list for CAP/C since 2010. My daughter was seen through a local LME and her mental health treatment was awful. She was placed on a high dosage of drugs and my concerns about her being a zombie were dismissed. After her second inpatient stay in a behavioral health hospital, she was fortunate to be able to receive services from Wake Forest Baptist Health Behavioral Health. She has a better, but not perfect outcome. She is still seeing a therapist that resides in the DSS system, but I think she is in need of something between weekly therapy and hospitalization. There seems to be nothing.
My sons with autism get no treatment from the Medicaid system. I did, while I could afford it, send them to a group therapy type setting once a week at a local non-profit. My older son fell into a gap between younger kids and older teens. He stopped going for that reason. My other son did not seem to benefit much. He would benefit from individual assistance, but he lost his IEP due to not acting autistic enough for his teachers. I suppose they only understand autism through movies like Rain Man.
Switching to a system that rewards medical professionals for providing less services to increase their bottom line is a horrible idea. It is already difficult to have busy providers listen to the underlying issues of children's problems, without knowing that ignoring my child's maladies contribute to the bottom line. Not saying all providers would do this, but when you have an elusive diagnosis, like autism can be, it would be easier to just ignore symptoms of higher functional autistic children. The same for children with anxiety disorders.",209041,27 Jun 2016 20:51:14
"Medical care of low income people is complicated in many ways for the doctors, nurses, and PA's that care for them. Minimizing the complications of the system of care is essential in order to allow as much attention as possible to be given to the care of the patients.
The proposal submitted by the state of North Carolina would add harmful complexity, like all other multiple insurer situations that I am aware of.

I believe that if you review the performance of our current system, Community Care of North Carolina, you will find that it performs so well that there is no reason to launch alternative demonstration experiments. CCNC is a national model, being able to document savings of $1B from 2007-2010 (Millman Inc report Dec 2011), and receiving the Hearst Health Prize from the Jefferson College of Population Health in March of 2016. It has grown organically and deliberatively from a Wilson County project developed by a community-minded physician 25 years ago and has incorporated all appropriate concepts of health information, integration between providers and other community resources, and quality improvement. Designed and managed by providers, it is responsive to the needs of providers and patients.

CCNC has always cared about patients and providers. I doubt that the managed care entities that this proposal would permit would do the same. I believe that intent is a major determinant of outcome.",209045,28 Jun 2016 14:57:19

Expand Medicaid in NC! It's just common sense.,209053,29 Jun 2016 09:28:25
This bill/Waiver is completely ludicrous. It ignores and disbands a Nationally recognized Medicaid program in Community Care of North Carolina. CCNC and its 14 statewide networks has proven to be an efficient and cost effective approach to managing Medicaid dollars. It has also increased the access and quality of care that our most vulnerable patients receive. They are a leading example of how to reign in cost and increase quality. The Waiver would strip North Carolina of a program that many other states would love to duplicate. I would ask CMS to reject this waiver as there is no need to fix what is not broken but in fact working quite efficiently. Thank you.,209057,29 Jun 2016 12:01:38
"Thank you for the opportunity to comment on the Medicaid Reform Waiver Application. We are

the largest pediatric group in NC, recognized by NCQA as a Patient Centered Medical Home

with 17 sites serving 64 of 100 counties, with more than 100,000 pediatric visits per year.

Our largest focus with medicaid reform is to maintain/ improve access to care for the children of

North Carolina. With recent medicaid cuts, access to care has been significantly compromised

with many private offices no longer accepting medicaid patients or have had to close down due

to lack of financial sustainability. This in turn has increased the burden on emergency rooms

which is a major contributor to rising healthcare costs. Hence, we urge you to revise provider

reimbursement rates and ensure they are comparable to Medicare rates to ensure access to care.

As a group, our mission is to provide accessible, affordable, quality care. By honoring same day

appointments, walk-ins and extended hour clinic, we have a proven track record in effectively

reducing emergency room visits and hospitalizations. With a focus on quality based care,

practice reimbursement rates should ensure pay for achievable quality performance measures.

We urge you to ensure medicaid reform addresses these key elements assuring access and quality

of care provided to the children of NC.",209061,29 Jun 2016 12:47:38

"I am opposed to reforming North Carolina Medicaid as proposed. The changes appeared as a result of pressures to privatize Medicaid in order to have predictable state budgets. The care of patients under the current non-for-profit system called Community Care of North Carolina (CCNC) received national recognition for innovation in healthcare, and created an infrastructure which is threatened to be dismantled under the new proposal. CCNC proven results include cost savings in the millions of dollars for North Carolina, year after year, in reduced emergency room utilization or hospitalizations. Many of the potential benefits in the proposed change already exist under CCNC. Privatization will result in increased costs to tax payers (federal and state), and line the pockets of for-profit companies not even located in North Carolina. The current CCNC managed care infrastructure is intimately aligned with safety net providers as well. Disruption and reorganization, especially for safety net providers, in a time with concurrent rapid change in healthcare alliances and ACO structures is further distancing our healthcare organizations from the people we serve. Given the difficult political climate, the lack of expansion of Medicaid in North Carolina, the minimal adoption of access to insurances through the exchange (few choices) from the Affordable Care Act, the threat to care of those accessing care through safety net providers is no small concern. If the vision for the future of North Carolina Medicaid as proposed were driven by the best quality of care for the citizens of North Carolina, then I would support it. Innovation and competition could benefit our state and reduce costs to tax payers. This proposal is politically motivated and shameful. It doesn't have to be inevitable, if Federal-level decision makers have the authority and will to block it.",209077,30 Jun 2016 14:08:47
"I feel Medicaid should be available to individuals who are in need of a service regardless of their age, race or if their income is higher than poverty level. I personally make this comment because I work at a low salary but when I had cancer, I could not afford the copays, deductibles and the medication I had to buy out of pocket. Four years later, I am still paying for hospital bills associated with the cancer. I was more fortunate than most, but at that particular time all I could think was if I could just get a little help get over the hump. It has created a hardship for myself. It makes you feel like you can not go for tests because you adding one more bill. There should be a way for all people to benefit when there is a need. There should also be a way to prevent the fraud of these programs. Most of the fraud comes from people not seeing a regular doctor especially children. There seems to be a stigma of who cares about going to the doctor when we can just go to the ER. I can not afford the ER and people have the attitude to for symptoms associated with STDs, to find out they are pregnant, etc. Most of these can be treated at a doctor rather than an ER.",209081,1 Jul 2016 08:42:41
"I am a primary care pediatrician practicing in a private practice in a rural part of North Carolina. I have significant concerns that the Medicaid reform proposal will hurt an already successful program

ACCESS
Complexity may reduce access. With a basic model of 15 different Medicaid insurance companies (PHP – Prepaid Health Plans), complexity is inherent in the design. Complexity would likely reduce access to care not just for children insured through Medicaid and Health Choice, but all children, especially in rural areas. (For example, if practices close rather than make all the changes needed to participate with PHPs; if providers spend more time on paperwork and less time on patient care; if pediatricians chose to retire rather than deal with all the new and multiple requirements, etc.)

Payment structure may reduce access and quality of care. Higher percentages of payment going to PHP means less money for health care for children. A survey of NC pediatricians by NCPeds in March 2015 found that recent cuts (relating to loss of the ACA bump plus state changes) led practices to limit the number of Medicaid patients and that additional cuts would likely lead to limits on seeing Medicaid patients (46%), staff lay-offs (31%), practice closures (8%), and retiring earlier than planned (17%). If there are fewer practitioners or practices, all children in the area will lose access to care, not just those with public health insurance.

Networks may not have adequate access to pediatric providers, especially specialists. There are only a handful of pediatric specialists, such as urologists, in the state. It is unclear how access to needed specialists for children will be assured. Adult specialists who also see children (such as ENTs) may not want to deal with increased hassle of multiple different Medicaid plans for low payment on a handful of children.

LOSS OF CCNC
CCNC provides important benefits for child health. CCNC has a proven effective strategy to improve care while reducing cost. While DHHS clearly intends to keep many of the elements of CCNC, CCNC itself will go away. Instead of one care manager and one set of metrics, practices may have to deal with five (or more depending on their region). The state will lose the focus, improved quality and reduced cost that CCNC has been able to achieve. Practices could become frustrated and scattered as a different PHP comes in with a different area of focus, different QI initiatives, etc.",209085,1 Jul 2016 12:03:43

"With decades of experience, I fear and suspect reorganization of Medicaid services to children will be detrimental to patients and providers/ quality of care and economics. North Carolina since the 1970s had evolved to become an enviable system of health care delivery to children with organizational and funding success. Importantly, physical driven initiatives had brought expanded enrollment of children with ever expanding cost saving strategies--all driven its the conceptual goal that more savings resultant from unified provider support would be turned to generate and fund services to more children. The millions of savings did not go to providers, vendors or organizational entities. CCNC was our award winning consistent tool to bring much of this success.

Being a solo provider, I am aware that bureaucratic , organizational layers added will have continuous pressure to diminish reimbursement to providers and divert segments of value to any entity placed between layers of organization. Cost containment in such a way diverts a significant portion of value away from reinforcing re-imbursement for quality care. This is cost containment tool dressed as an effort to improve care. With the best of intention(I am unsure this is the case) and appropriately focused entities, this will take decades to become effective--yet impositions of structural changes will come forth in abundance.

With a system that diminishes reimbursement while it imposes layers of administrative demands, solo and small practices will struggle. I believe the CCNC model from its early years is the best model for child advocacy in North Carolina. Politically driven changes have a poor track record with which to challenge CCNC success. The NC Pediatric Society and its members have long been committed to our state's children. Why do we seek to kill off a proven great success?",209093,1 Jul 2016 13:14:00

"I have been a provider of pediatric general primary care in a moderate sized community in central North Carolina for the past 17 years. I have appreciated working with the physician lead entity call Community Care of North Carolina for these years to help reduce the cost of quality medicaid services for pateints in North Carolina. We have been a model for other states in keeping costs down, I strongly oppose the proposed waiver to CMS to change the NC Medicaid program to a managed care organization model from the current fee for service model. I predict that these changes will result in profits for third party insurers at the expense of primary care providers, resulting in far fewer primary care providers willing to see Medicaid patients. Our practice is the largest provider of Pediatric primary care in our service area of over 250,000 people. We will very likely be forced to drastically reduce our Medicaid insured numbers if our reinbursements are reduced as I predict under this model. We will be forced into a higher degree of administrative paperwork dealing with multiple Medicaid HMOs, increasing our costs to continue to see these patients. I strongly urge CMS to reject this proposed change and continue to allow North Carolina to provide high quality and cost effective pediatrics care for our children under Medicaid and the CCNC. If nothing else, please exclude children 18 and under from these proposed changes.

"1. I would love to see some ""out the box"" thinking when it comes to the integration of behavioral health care and primary care.

2. As a behavioral health provider and owner of group practice, it would be wonderful if the MCO's would """"allow"""" me to contract with physicians and place skilled licensed behavioral health providers in the physicians office to do behavioral health assessments, emergency counseling, EAP type referral counseling, etc. However, that would mean they would have to allow the group practice to ""add a location"" - the physician's office.
That has not been allowed since soon after the MCO.s took over (about 3 years ago?) One can't grow the behavioral health group practice with medicaid, because additional offices can not be utilized - that is ""adding a location"" and is rejected.

"I have serious reservations about this waiver generally because everything that has been wrong with the Medicaid system can be fixed with stronger over site. What seems to be missing is it looks like an attempt to privatize Medicaid and to not expand Medicaid. I have listen to providers they have great reservation about these proposed changes along with hundreds that work with the Medicaid population and most importantly the patients that this will effect in a negative way are not being taken into consideration. It appears the recipients will be taking the fall for gross negligence by DHHS how many times has the Federal Administration of DHHS had to literally slap NC hands over the mess and poor operation of the current system. There are patients now that are not receiving adequate healthcare and this will make that worst. I understand that they will be given a choice between HMO's and if they do not then one will be chosen for them, but look at the demographics of this population many or most do not have the literacy or the means to make that type of decision. What they need is access to healthcare and an increase in the number of providers. Providers that are not saddled with getting permission from a HMO who by their very essence look at cost and delay or deny more service and take the decisions away from providers. . There is a proven system with CCNC that has saved the Medicaid system millions of dollars why would you dismantle a model that has proven to work and in fact other states have modeled a system similar because of the cost savings. This seems more political than it does to improve the healthcare of Medicaid recipients. Why is the question? In conclusion there is much that needs to be reviewed and looked at but to throw the baby out with the bathwater is foolish. Please consider the impact this will have on the recipients rather than trying to except responsibility for bad over site . Keep what has been working and correct the problems that have been well documented . Expand Medicaid please too many in the state have fallen permanently it looks like into a hole with no way out and yes there are those that die r/t no access to healthcare in a country as rich as this this is nothing to be proud of .

"I urge the state to expand Medicaid in every county in North Carolina.

Hundreds of thousand of people will not have health insurance, and thus not have access to preventative and continuing health care, if we don't.

Thousands of people will continue to die each year unnecessarily and preventably if we don't, because Medicaid expansion is a matter of life and death. A 2012 study from the Harvard School of Public Health found that expanding Medicaid by 500,000 enrollees is associated with 2,840 fewer deaths each year. This is the number of people estimated to enroll if North Carolina expanded Medicaid. A 2014 study in Health Affairs noted that if the expansion population is healthier than expected we may see between 455 and 1,145 fewer deaths each year after expansion.

Thousands of people will lose jobs, and will not get new jobs that are there for the asking, if we don't. A 2014 report from the Center for Health Policy Research at The George Washington University, with partners Cone Health Foundation and Kate B Reynolds Charitable Trust (available at www.ncmedicaidexpansion.com) shows that North Carolina could gain $21 billion in federal tax revenue statewide, create 43,000 jobs, and generate $161 million in new county tax revenue between 2016 and 2020 if the state closes the coverage gap.

Not expanding Medicaid is an extreme example of ideological devastation, in a legislative session characterized by ideological devastation. It costs nothing to do, and the failure to do it means over 300,000 people do not have health insurance, do not have access to preventative and ongoing health care, that thousands of people will die, and thousands of people will lose jobs and do not get jobs that are there for the asking, all for some misguided ideological excuse.

Have humanity, be human, do it.

"Thank you for the opportunity to comment on North Carolina's Medicaid Reform 1115 Demonstration. North Carolina has proposed a major change to the delivery of Medicaid in our state. One of the goals of the waiver is to connect children and families to better health. While we appreciate the extension of eligibility to families in the child welfare system, we remain deeply concerned about the hundreds of thousands of North Carolinians who will remain without access to care under the proposed plan. We urge North Carolina's leaders to expand Medicaid eligibility as permitted by the Affordable Care Act, thus providing essential health care access to more than 300,000 individuals in our state who currently have no other options available to them. They do not fall into an eligible category for Medicaid and they earn too little to qualify for financial assistance in the Health Insurance Marketplace. Here in Mecklenburg County, we have over 32,000 individuals in the coverage gap.1 Left without any options, they must rely on charity, free clinics, and the emergency room for care. Lack of coverage can also result in death. Estimates indicate from 450 to 1,100 North Carolinians die unnecessarily every year because they have no access to care.2
Extending coverage will not only benefit the health of North Carolinians, but also family finances as well as county and state-level economies. In NC, we know that closing the Coverage Gap will help nearly 15,000 families avoid financial stress annually as they are less likely to encounter costly medical bills.3 On the county level, we know that closing the Gap will help 16 rural hospitals keep their doors open.4 Statewide we know that 43,000 jobs would have been created by 2020 if policymakers would have accepted full federal funding to increase all North Carolinians' access to care in 2016.5
· States that have expanded Medicaid have improved financial well-being for new enrollees, leading to fewer unpaid bills. Research estimates that expansion reduced third-party collections by $600 to $1000 per individual in expansion states.8
· Expanded Medicaid has been a common contributor to job growth and positive economic impacts over time through the influx of federal funding, increased state and local business activity, and collected tax revenues.

"Children are a majority of the affected caseload for medicaid reform. CCNC has been very helpful in ensuring that many of these needy children did not fall through the cracks and received necessary mental health and physical services. Providers that take medicaid already have to jump through many hoops. Fragmenting this system further will be devastating for access to care--having multiple medicaid plans will mean that fewer providers continue to offer medicaid. Already there are many issues with access and quality of care for children with medicaid, the area that I am most familiar with is mental health. Unfortunately children living in poverty suffer more frequently adverse life events are are more likely to have mental health care needs. Unfortunately with the fragmentation of the system many child psychiatrists and other providers already aren't taking medicaid or taking a limited number because of low reimbursement. Fragmenting this system and creating multiple types of medicaid will only make this much worse. There is clear data that not only treatment for things such as abuse and resulting Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, anxiety, depression, early onset psychosis can lead to better outcomes in multiple levels. The best part is the providing necessary care to these children actually saves the system lots of money long term and this has been shown in many early intervention trials and specific types of mental health treatment. The savings comes from reduction in hospital costs, reduction in missed work days, reduction in hospitalizations and long term care facilities and juvenile justice and adult criminal justice systems.
If medicaid became more fragmented and there were fewer providers this state would see an immediate cost because of lack of outpatient providers an increase in hospitalizations and long term care placements which are both extremely expensive. Ultimately the best thing for children and the system long term is to keep organizations like CCNC, keep medicaid from further fragmenting and enable outpatient providers to give quality care to the children who most need it.",209141,6 Jul 2016 07:41:22
"As a provider in a pediatric practice that is over 55% medicaid, I strongly feel that fragmenting the current system, deleting the cost effective CCNC program (which has been a model for other states),adding additional layers of administration and bureaucracy, financially squeezing those of us in the ""trenches"" and not addressing more effective and appropriate consumer use of the Medicaid program will lead to a recipe for disaster. We need proactive parent education about managing simple childhood illnesses and appropriate use of ERs and offices - maybe CCNC can work with communities to help teach young parents? If we are unable to have people have any buy in/skin in the game with a small copay to help control costs, what about a consumption tax on tattoos (as there is on cigarettes and alcohol) to help fund the program? In a 2 week observation period, 80% of my Medicaid patients' parents had visible tattoos.....radical idea? I think we need to address the precise problems that those of us diagnosing and treating children and families see, not ideas hatched by non-clinical people who see more administrators as they answer to health care problems.",209145,6 Jul 2016 12:22:33

"I am a pediatrician who serves many children who have Medicaid insurance. In order to have a viable new system, it must:
1) Be easy to use for healthcare providers and offices: there is a potential that my office will have to work with 15 Medicaid companies under the new plan. We will be unable to conform to all the bureaucracy and different rules for 15 different companies. If this is the case, we will likely be forced to choose 1 or 2 that we are willing to work with. This means we will have to turn away children who are covered by the other companies.
2) Focus on fair Medicaid payments: physicians in NC have already endured payment cuts in 2016, if private companies take a percentage of payments, this means payments for physicians may be cut further. We are businesses, too. We cannot pay our staff, nurses, computers, and rent if payments are cut further.
3) Maintain adequate access to care: there is no clear plan set forth on how the network of specialists, access to therapies and other services will be handled within the new Medicaid health plans.
4) Uphold CCNC: CCNC is the only Medicaid-affiliated organization that I work with that provides positive engagement. The organization has a proven track record of cost savings while working collaboratively with physicians and patients. They are genuinely interested in my feedback and suggestions to improve care for Medicaid patients.
5) Be receptive to the feedback of providers and patients: I am discouraged to see that the extensive feedback from the public that was solicited in the NC DHHS Listening Sessions and forums did not translate into substantive revisions in the current waiver application.",209153,6 Jul 2016 20:13:24

"I have been a practicing Pediatrician in Moore county for the past 40yrs. I am dismayed and disgusted over the proposed changes to our current Medicaid reimbursement system.

The majority of Pediatricians in North Carolina are extremely pleased with the current CCNC network and one payer system. This system has been recognized by other states as a model which efficiently cares for the needs of the children covered by Medicaid. Pediatricians across the state have risen to the challenge of reducing medical costs by judiciously prescribing medications and expanding their office hours to accommodate their patients in a medical home. These factors alone have dramatically reduced unnecessary ER visits. Over my years in practice I have taken pride in caring for those children most in need of my services.

Those changes will take a simple, easy to understand system and replace it with multiple entities, each with different billing, referral, and prescribing rules. The new complexity will put an extreme burden on already stressed primary care practices. The only way for my practice to handle this will be to limit the number of entities we deal with and therefore limit the number of medicaid patients we will be able to see. We are in a rural area, and that will severely limit the options our patients will have. Our current system of community care networks has been a model for the nation and has saved billions since it's inception. The system is known and coverage is simple. We have never had to limit access, and have never been closed to medicaid in the 50 years our practice has existed. That will change under the plan that is proposed. Kids will lose access and will be forced to search for other options. It is a terrible idea.",209169,7 Jul 2016 21:52:47

"The failure by North Carolina to include Medicaid expansion in its reform demonstration is inexplicable and inexcusable.
See below:
Here's an indisputable fact: By closing the Medicaid coverage gap our legislators could prevent more than 1100 deaths in North Carolina each year (http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMsa1202099#t=articleTop) and legislators can't plead ignorance because they've been reminded repeatedly, in public. Most of these avoidable deaths occur among the working poor Americans who, without Medicaid, must rely on emergency rooms.

Denied access to lifesaving preventative and follow up care, they die.
Our legislators have certain knowledge that each year they refuse to close the Medicaid gap they will kill about 1100 innocent people and yet they continue to refuse.

Here's my question: How is our legislature's knowingly killing thousands of innocent people by refusing Medicaid expansion different in simple moral terms from a terrorist's walking into a public place and using an assault rifle? Don't the legislature's victims also count?

Thinking of terrorists killing innocent victims in America frightens us. But shouldn't we be more frightened of our legislature? After all, in the years after 9/11/2001, terrorists have killed 94 people in our homeland (http://securitydata.newamerica.net/extremists/deadly-attacks.html ), whereas, by refusing to expand Medicaid, our legislature continues to cause the preventable deaths of 1100 innocent North Carolinians each year.

"I have grave concerns about the NCDHHS proposal to allow managed care companies to oversee Medicaid services. The administration of the program needs to be entirely managed by the state for the benefit of patients, not for the benefit of any private insurance company. Our governor and legislature have insisted that our Medicaid program was ""broken,"" when in fact it has been a model, award winning program that has been efficiently run.

The most disturbing thing about NC's proposed waiver is the omission of Medicaid expansion. It is inhumane to leave 500,000 people - the majority of whom hold one or more jobs - in the coverage gap, with no possible means of obtaining health insurance. It is inhumane, in a state that has suffered tremendous job loss over the last 2 decades, to decline the 40,000 jobs that Medicaid expansion would create by 2020. It is inhumane to indifferently stand by and watch hospitals in poor, rural communities close, depriving those communities of critical care and major employment. We have already seen a 49 year old mother die of heart failure because her town's hospital closed, and the nearest one was 70 miles away.

Polls have shown that the majority of North Carolinians (in both parties) are in favor of expanding Medicaid, and statewide pressure on our legislators has grown. The legislators in power, however, have boxed themselves in a corner by publically (and legislatively) refusing to cooperate with any aspect of ""Obamacare.""

"Dear CMS Representative:
First, thank you for the opportunity to make comments about the Medicaid 1115 waiver for NC. As someone who has spent over 30 years in the commercial health insurance and health plan sectors, I understand first hand how critically important it is to have accessible and affordable health care services available to all Americans. In my view, there is no rationale for limiting health care to the current eligibility categories of Medicaid in NC or to the status of each North Carolinian's personal employment . Unfortunately, our current legislative leadership does not seem swayed by the facts- either the personal stories of their constituents or of the financial impacts of not expanding Medicaid (43,000 jobs lost, $21B lost, etc.). In fact, anything remotely associated with Obama and ObamaCare is rejected wholesale without any coherent rationale. So, in light of the opportunity of the submission of this waiver I ask that you consider a way to incorporate Medicaid expansion into the waiver implementation and include over 500,000 North Carolinans who are currently denied access to Medicaid. When better to expand coverage then as part of the implementation of new provider entities and new ways to deliver care to needy North Carolinians?

"Dear Friend,

As a navigator for the ACA for the past three years here in NC, I have been in the the very demoralizing position of having to tell more than one potential consumer that s/he did not qualify for financial support for purchasing health insurance because they did not make enough money (even though some of them were working full-time) nor qualify for Medicaid. Therefore, in my mind, the ""reform"" that is being contemplated for Medicaid in NC must include expansion of the benefits.

As you have no doubt already been told, here are some of the costs for not expanding Medicaid:
--1 in 5 adults under 65 remains uninsured in NC
--Not expanding Medicaid is already hindering job creation and economic growth because NC is not capturing billions in federal matching dollars that would otherwise flow into the state economy to make expansion more affordable
--If NC does not expand Medicaid by 2016, $21 billion in federal matching funds will be lost between 2016 and 2020.
--Statewide, about half the jobs not created would be in health care (hospitals and clinics); almost half would be in other sectors such as construction or retail and wholesale trade.
--Small hospitals and clinics have had to close--particularly affecting rural poor.

Non-economic reasons to expand Medicaid:
--When parents are insured, their children are more likely to be insured and they are better able to care for their children.
--By not closing the gap, the cycle of poverty and sickness continues. Consequences of families falling into crisis because of a lack of health coverage and a medical crisis include foreclosures and evictions--having to make the decision to pay the rent or pay for much needed medication.

Respectfully,

"MEDICAID EXPANSION

Dear Reader:

As you work on the waiver for North Carolina, please ensure that the requirements for the Medicaid Expansion be included. There are the humane reasons for doing this such as reducing the preventable deaths from the group of nearly one-half million people who are not covered by the Affordable Care Act. Also, 27,000 people in this gap who have diabetes and are not getting treated.

The diabetes problem is a lead into the positive economic impact including Medicaid Expansion would have. Some inancial incentives and considerations follow:
• Management of diabetes saves later extreme costs of late-stage diabetes treatment
• ""Since January 1, 2014 NC has rejected $4.9 million per day.""
• ""Take the Money – don't leave $15 billion on the table.""
• ""Keep NC tax dollars here in NC.""
• ""Expanding Medicaid is good for NC businesses including hospitals.""
• ""Insuring half a million North Carolinians is cost effective and humane.""

Recently, I volunteered at a Community Health Center where a woman who was eight-months pregnant came in. She did not know how to get medical attention. The Health Center was not able to help her. We need a health system that covers everyone. We cannot have gaps where diseases are not treated, where prevention is not emphasized, and where strong economic practices are not embraced.",209305,12 Jul 2016 08:46:26

We are also concerned about how the number of outstanding issues will be resolved, including details on how administrative ease will be assured, payment levels, structure and payment of telehealth, network adequacy, Chapter 58 protections and other factors.
How these ""details"" are resolved will have a substantial impact on the ability of pediatricians to keep practicing and to continue to serve publicly insured children. Since the vast majority of people with health insurance through Medicaid and Health Choice are under age 21, Medicaid reform won't work if it doesn't work for children and the professionals who care for them.
The consequences are substantial for children who are mostly healthy.

Private practices cannot afford the resources needed to deal with a more complicated, multi- MCO system with different sets of rules and payment methods.

Please allow the current CCNC system to continue it's good work, so we can care for our patients.",209337,12 Jul 2016 11:21:41
"As a Medicaid Reform plan is formulated, I think it is very important that closing the coverage gap be included in a new plan. The federal government has offered us a path to helping up to half a million of NC's most vulnerable citizens have access to health care, and yet we persist in sending our federal tax dollars elsewhere. This is not the kind of state we want to be. Further, a majority of North Carolinians support closing the gap, as most other states have done by now. Even the wealthiest among us cannot support lowering taxes at the expense of those who are struggling the most. No one is immune to catastrophic health incidents, but they are more catastrophic to those who cannot afford health care. Many of these folks are working, but they are the working poor. They are the caretakers for our elderly parents, daycare workers caring for our children, maids in the hotels where we vacation. More importantly, many of these individuals are children who have no control over the wealth of the family they are born into. We say we want the best opportunity for every child in NC, but we withhold federal dollars that could help them. From a strict financial standpoint, many states have already shown that there is financial gain to closing the gap. Those gains are evident at every level from local government to state benefits. We have that data...we are not charting new territory here. There are many excuses for not closing this gap, but they are not authentic ones. The data show unequivocally that there are many layers of benefits from such action. I urge policymakers to follow the facts and use not just their heads but also their hearts to help those who need it most.",209341,12 Jul 2016 11:22:25
"We at Salisbury Pediatrics have been taking care of Medicaid children since our inception over 50 years ago. We are an 18 provider pediatric practice that has prided ourselves on caring for all North Carolinians. The recent Medicaid cuts and current rates are making it difficult to run a practice and continue to care for Medicaid children. We will seriously consider changing our Medicaid enrollment numbers and having these children use urgent and ER care at a much higher cost and with less quality.

It is unconscionable that our services are not worth at least Medicare rates let alone commercial insurance for the same service provided. In order to continue to care for the children of this state, we are asking the government to equalize Medicaid rates to Medicare. This is what is right and just.

We love the kids of this state and hope to continue to provide for them for another 50 years.

"Thank you for the opportunity to respond to the 1115 Waiver submitted by the North Carolina DHHS. I have read and agree with the majority of comments which have been made to date especially those which support CCNC and Medicaid expansion for NC. Having practiced pediatrics in NC for almost 40 years I have seen the access problems which existed for the Medicaid patient prior to CCNC. Because of the complexity of the proposed system of 15 different payers and the for-profit nature of commercial MCO's I fear that pediatric offices will op out or decrease the panel size of the Medicaid patient.This will create access issues and end up sending more Medicaid patients to the ER's, increased hospital admissions and readmission's with the resultant increase in cost to both the State and Federal governments, i.e. the tax payers. To do away with CCNC, as the 1115 waver does, is doing a grave disservice to our patients, our providers, and to the tax payers. I urge the officials at CMS to reject NC's bid for the 1115 waver as it is presently written.",209357,12 Jul 2016 12:56:30
"As a pediatrician, I can only say that this is going to be a disaster. Multiple providers of medicaid services with multiple rules, drug lists, preauthorization rules, reimbursements, etc. Medicaid is already one of the most cumbersome insurance providers to deal with and this will only make it worse. Medicaid has the lowest reimbursement already and now you guys plan to add layers of hassle and complexity.

Let me give you an example, currently medicaid has a preferred drug list. This is designed to save millions of dollars for the state every year. As a practicing physician, how do I know what medications are on the PDL? Is my EMR interfaced with the PDL like with other insurance companies? No. Do I have an app on my phone like with other insurance companies? No. Is the PDL constantly updates, so that I always know when a change has been made to the PDL? No. We are talking about a multimillion dollar list here. So how is this information made available to me? There is a PDF file I can download off the internet to my laptop. Then I can use the ""find"" feature in Adobe acrobat to try and search for certain medication within this PDF file. How do I find out when a medication has been added or removed from the PDL? I try to prescribe a medication and the pharmacy or patient calls my office and says ""medicaid will not pay for it."" What? The PDL says it is preferred. ""No, apparently that changed last month, Doc."" Great. I guess I need to go download a new copy of the medicaid PDL PDF file. This is medicaid in 2016. Bush league. Now we are going to cut it into a bunch of pieced and what is going to emerge is going to be more successful? Ha. You guys are great.


Providers are simply going to walk away from medicaid and you are going to hurt the patients, mostly children, by decreasing their access to healthcare. Sure, you will tell us we are going to be paid more due to all the cost savings. Please, don't pee on our backs and tell us it's raining.",209361,12 Jul 2016 13:17:40
"I grew up in California, spent 7 years in Nebraska going to school and have been in North Carolina for twenty years. I have watched multiple variations of insurance-directed Medicaid tried and fail all across the country. North Carolina has been blessed with an effective and cost-effective system for many years. It is sad to me that out governor would dismantle that system and put that money in the pockets of private insurance companies. The biggest sufferers will be the children who are served by NC Medicaid.
I am a proud partner in a 50 year old practice of primary care pediatrics in a suburban clinic. We are 65% Medicaid and are glad to serve this community.

I have worked in NC for 30 years and was in private practice when Managed Care came in as PCP and Maxicare. Neither program succeeded because of too much administration. Paying someone else to manage medicaid means less money for providers and therefore less access for patients.

I strongly oppose scrapping the current nonprofit Community Care of North Carolina system for a for private managed care. The latter would add more bureaucratic interfaces for already burdened physician practices, increasing the cost and frustrations of providing care to an already sicker, poorer group for whose care they are either not reimbursed or are paid at a very low level. That would result in fewer physicians accepting fewer patients in this category. We very much, however, need expansion of Medicaid in North Carolina, and that has been rejected by the current General Assembly and governor of our state. The use of the word ""reform"" by this legislation implies that better things are coming; the facts speak otherwise and in my opinion this is just one more manifestation of a far-right political agenda, not in the interests of the poor which it purports to serve, but to enrich those who already are doing well.

Rural hospitals need the revenue to keep open to serve all citizens in the area, not just those on Medicaid.

"I am a pediatric ophthalmologist who has practiced in the State of North Carolina for the last 13 years. My practice cares for a large population of children insured under NC Medicaid.

Allowing out of state, for-profit entities to administer the NC Medicaid program would not serve the interests of the people of North Carolina. This arrangement has been utilized in other states with less than great success. These companies (with deep pockets and significant political influence) demand profitability. These profits funds must come from decreasing reimbursements to hospitals and health care providers in such a scenario, as state funding would be set.

While contracting with for-profit entities would make budgeting easier (and ostensibly more stable), if the for-profit entities do not realize the profitability they seek, they will simply opt out of contract renewal and leave the state. It is my understanding that this has happened in a number of states across the country and has left these states ""in the lurch"".

North Carolina has a better solution already in place.

Community Care of North Carolina (CCNC) has become a model for the country with proven cost savings realized through medically sound initiatives that have saved the State of North Carolina millions of dollars. By the governor's own admission, NC Medicaid has run in the black for the past two years WITHOUT the need to have for-profit entities administer the NC Medicaid program.

As demands for medical services increases and funding them becomes increasingly difficult, we must carefully consider how our resources are allocated. These financial resources must be targeted as directly as possible to the actual patient care, not corporate profitability.

"I am a pediatrician practicing over 30 years in NC.
The Medicaid system in NC, run by Community Care of NC (CCNC) has been a model of care delivery that has received national recognition. CCNC has saved the state millions of dollars. It has been budget neutral despite having much greater enrollment. It has provided untold number of kids a ""Medical Home"" where providers expert in the care of children, pediatricians, family practice doctors, physicians' assistants and nurse practitioners can provide continuity of medical care. It ensures that kids get needed preventive health care, immunizations, and coordinated care of both episodic and chronic illness in one place. This prevents needless use of the Emergency Department as a place of care for routine problems, and needless use of subspecialists, when the same care can be provided in the Medical Home for significantly less money. The waiver is to replace a system with low overhead with many different outside, for profit entities. This will force medical providers to deal with multiple different rules, regulations and payment systems. To make this system work, there will need to be money saved to pay the management entities. The only sources of this money would be to a) limit the types of services provided
b) limit the number of people eligible to receive services and c) limit the payment for these services to the providers. Children receiving Medicaid benefits typically have more medical needs. To limit the number of kids entitled to these benefits, and to cut the scope of what is covered would cause significant harm to our most vulnerable population. This could potentially prevent these kids from coming off Medicaid because of chronic disabilities that developed and could have been prevented. Reducing payments to providers can only drive many to stop taking Medicaid, limiting the availability of providers. NC Medicaid pays less than Medicare rates. At a minimum, Medicaid must pay at least as much as Medicare. Lower payments will drive providers to stop taking Medicaid. And in parts of the state where a practice may be 65+% Medicaid, payment cuts can be disastrous. Just because a medical service is covered doesn't mean patients have access to that service.

It is not fair for the children of NC to have more barriers to care placed upon them. I would hope that this proposal be reconsidered.

"The NC Medicaid Reform Demonstration waiver request is deeply flawed for the following reasons:
1. Capitated care as a structure for restrictions on cost thereby restricting care
2. Corporate, for-profit management which increases administrative costs
3. Competitive networks with overlapping wasteful bureaucracies
4. Dismantles the Community Care of North Carolina's well-developed non-profit, award-winning, provider-led regional networks which had some of the lowest administrative costs and the lowest annual increase in costs in the US
5. Lack of provision for North Carolinians who do not qualify for insurance. Specifically, this program does not provide expansion of Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act.
For those reasons, I request that you not allow this demonstration in its current form.

"The refusal to expand Medicaid amounts to an abdication of the duty to serve the people of North Carolina. People who do not have health insurance die prematurely. It is that simple.

I have practiced medicine in North Carolina since 1988. I am appalled that our government officials are so callous. Shouting that ""Medicaid is broken"" is not an excuse; it is a cop out!

We have the ability to improve the lives of more than 350,000 North Carolinians by expanding Medicaid. Ninety percent of the costs will be paid by the federal government. North Carolina will recoup any expenses by increased tax revenue and increased jobs that will come with expanding Medicaid.

I urge our members of the legislature to put politics aside and do what is right for the people of North Carolina.",209545,14 Jul 2016 10:01:29

"I am a general pediatrician practicing in rural NC for 20+ years. NC Medicaid WORKS there is no logical or sane reason to change a program that currently functions with a 6% administrative overhead to multiple entities who are ""allowed"" to have 12% administrative cost or more. Most pediatric practices in NC have 20-80% Medicaid patients. This change would restrict access by reducing the amount of providers who accept ""new"" Medicaid. This would shift care to more costly ERs and away from well established medical homes. This plan would be bad for children and their families, and would result in more costly, fragmented care for NC's most vulnerable citizens.",209565,14 Jul 2016 12:42:02
"As a pediatrician with over 15 years experience in the state, I am profoundly concerned by the proposed waiver. Medicaid cuts have already left our practice as the only one in all of southeastern North Carolina accepting new patients with Medicaid. Anything that increases our overhead, such as dealing with a potential 15 different payers just for Medicaid, or increases the complexity of our care, such as complying with 15 different sets of care guidelines, threatens our continued viability.

I also must emphasize that Pediatrics is a statewide practice, not a regional one. The waiver as constructed threatens to leave us nowhere to send children with orthopedic issues, genetic diseases, or complex congenital heart disease, as all these conditions require referral to the academic medical centers clustered in the central part of the state. Likewise, children and young families are highly mobile, and the regional networks threaten our ability to care for children who move from Greensboro or Asheville and need care immediately upon arriving in Wilmington.

One of the mandates of the Medicaid program is to provide accessible care to its recipients, most of whom are children. This waiver, if implemented as written, virtually guarantees the failure of that mandate. I am happy to speak further or answer any questions.

"NC Medicaid reform is an absolute terrible idea. North Carolina Medicaid expansion is NEEDED. A reform will reduce care availability, as well as compliance due to different issue; Mainly the issue of transportation. A medicaid reform will reduce and cut jobs for many individuals across North Carolina. Medicaid Reform will eliminate Patient Centered Medical Homes and create Person Center Health Communities. This will create over populated Health Communities and greatly reduce the quality of care that patients currently receive at PCMH facilities. By expanding Medicaid in this state it will allow providers to continue to grow as companies and build in the rural communities that is falsely believed to benefit from North Carolina Medicaid reform. Many providers now participate in PCMH programs that allow them to track and follow up with all patients needing and receiving current care. A Medicaid reform will restrict patients' choices and voice in choosing their medical provider which will reduce patient compliance.

The fact that they are working should be a qualifying not a disqualifying factor in consideration as to their eligibility. Let's not encourage laziness.

If non working adults with children qualify, what incentive would a hard working individual struggling to make ends meet have to continue working? We need a productive workforce!

"North Carolina's Medicaid reform plan lacks the most important change needed to improve health care for North Carolinians and strengthen the provider community — Medicaid expansion! Medicaid coverage should be extended to all adults ages 18-64 with incomes at or below 138% of the Federal Poverty Level (FPL). In North Carolina, expanded Medicaid would cover more than 400,000 people; at least 244,000 of those in the Coverage Gap are uninsured as a result.
In 2014, 43% of all community health center patients in North Carolina were uninsured and more than 70% of patients lived at or below 100% FPL. Community health center staff see firsthand the significant health challenges and barriers to needed services that these uninsured and low-income patients face. In North Carolina, nearly 40,000 women are not receiving recommended preventive screenings, 27,044 diabetics cannot get much needed medications, and 45,500 individuals with depression are not getting the treatment they need. In fact, providers often have to modify treatment plans for uninsured patients because of their inability to afford a specialist visit or pay for needed medications.

With Medicaid expansion, community health centers in North Carolina could better coordinate the full spectrum of care their patients need. Medicaid expansion would also bring new income to the community health centers that would enable them to expand sites and services, hire new staff, and integrate and improve the care they provide.

"I represent a pediatric practice seeing patients from the poorest county within the state. More than half of our patients are insured by Medicaid. To consider not expanding Medicaid will most certainly and detrimentally affect our bottom line but will, unfortunately, have the greatest impact upon our kids and our families. It would seem many decisions regarding proposed change have been isolated to budgetary concerns and a response to private parties lobbying for change. The current system is not perfect or without opportunities for improvement...but it does work. The stage is being set for corporate entities to benefit at the expense of our kids. As they rake their overhead portion of the management fee, proposed reimbursement will inevitably be reduced leaving providers with few options but referral to urgent and emergency care, ultimately affecting the quality of care.

The current system is efficient and streamlined enough to manage the patient's care. However, with the addition of multiple entities, with varying practices and procedures and a for-profit mindset, to manage the patient through each stage of care, seemingly will create chaos and ultimately affect the timeliness and quality of care we all strive to provide.

"My practice is one of the highest Medicaid volume practices in the Charlotte metro area. If the current proposal goes through, we will be forced to close to new Medicaid patients at a minimum. It is very likely we could withdraw from the program all together, thus forcing thousands of patients to find a new provider. Ethically, I have a serious problem with this situation. CCNC has proven it's value over the years. NC has lead the country in Medicaid metrics in the past. I fear this will be lost with the new proposal. Most importantly, I think we will create serious problems in caring for pediatric patients by applying the same policies and reforms to all ages of Medicaid recipients. The highest cost, and thus higher ROI for reform, is by starting with the adult population. Don't sacrifice the health of our children by applying the same broad stroke, one size fits all, methodology to all Medicaid recipients. At a minimum, a staged implementation for reform, with pediatrics being last, would be the most sensible compromise. In short, I feel the current proposal is short sighted and will be low value (high cost, low quality) in the future. The legislature has to understand that a program which does not meaningfully engage physicians and providers, thus having our support, is doomed to fail! We can't afford it financially. We can't afford it ethically. Policymakers, as well as providers, are in positions of influence and privilege.

"As a physician I have cared for patients with malignancies and no insurance. This had been extremely difficult for patients most often leading to a delay in diagnosis with more advanced disease and more debilitated patients before any treatment can be begun. My personal experience mirrors national data demonstrating inferior outcomes and higher death rates. On more than one occasion I have had patients decline any therapy concerned that they may bankrupt their families. It is morally unacceptable to deny coverage to 300,000 folks in NC who have no other health coverage options, those who fall into the gap below 100% of the federal poverty limit. Best estimates are that it would cost the state less than $1000/patient to provide them with excellent medical coverage (total cost less than $300 million when all costs and increased state revenues are considered). In a state budget of $22.7 billion with $2 billion in tax breaks given in recent years it is not only unreasonable but unethical to leave the most vulnerable of our fellow citizens without acceptable life saving care.

Working in a community health center (Piedmont Health Services) I see many people who cannot afford the minimum $25 fee to come in regularly, can't afford their multiple medicines, even though we discount them heavily and go without for months. It is financially out of the question to try to get a procedure or specialty consultation done outside our facility. Many have a car and some have a house, making them ineligible for medicaid, yet they are quite cash deficient.

I read the summary report of the Mediciaid waiver open forums held across the state of North Carolina in March and April.

In Greenville over 75 people stood up to speak about the plans for North Carolina's Medicaid waiver. We talked about decreased access. We talked about fractionated coverage. We talked about how the loss of our care coordination ability through Community Care of North Carolina will be as drastic setback to our care patients. No one in attendance stood up and supported the waiver in any fashion. My pediatric colleagues report similar experiences at all of the other sessions.

They have three children and she is trained as an LPN. She is not able to work F/T due to family and single parent responsibilities, and so does not have health insurance available to her. It saddens me to see how she receives no preventative care that I take for advantage as having with my BCBS plan, and she is forced to use the UNC (charity care) for urgent and medical care needs. Having even a basic preventative plan would go a long way, and I would recommend the state to consider this.

In addition, in my work as a visiting nurse, I see many low income elders cared for by low income family members in their homes. These family members work hard, but at low income positions that often do not offer insurance plans. Again, I see this group skipping all preventative care as they can not afford the extremely high cost of a basic MD visit. Offering a plan with expanded Medicaid would go far in achieving a Healthy Carolinians goal. I encourage the leaders to become more familiar with the populations who are truly working hard yet struggling without health insurance.",209761,15 Jul 2016 06:22:50
I am a physician in NC caring for Medicaid children. 50-60% depending on the month is how many children come to my office with Medicaid.

"After witnessing patients and friends/family not able to receive healthcare services because they don't have health insurance it's extremely disheartening because everyone deserves the opportunity to receive healthcare services.

"North Carolina's Medicaid reform plan lacks the most important change needed to improve health care for North Carolinians and strengthen the provider community — Medicaid expansion! Medicaid coverage should be extended to all adults ages 18-64 with incomes at or below 138% of the Federal Poverty Level (FPL). In North Carolina, expanded Medicaid would cover more than 400,000 people; at least 244,000 of those in the Coverage Gap are uninsured as a result.

In 2014, 43% of all community health center patients in North Carolina were uninsured and more than 70% of patients lived at or below 100% FPL. Community health center staff see firsthand the significant health challenges and barriers to needed services that these uninsured and low-income patients face. In North Carolina, nearly 40,000 women are not receiving recommended preventive screenings, 27,044 diabetics cannot get much needed medications, and 45,500 individuals with depression are not getting the treatment they need. In fact, providers often have to modify treatment plans for uninsured patients because of their inability to afford a specialist visit or pay for needed medications.

With Medicaid expansion, community health centers in North Carolina could better coordinate the full spectrum of care their patients need. Medicaid expansion would also bring new income to the community health centers that would enable them to expand sites and services, hire new staff, and integrate and improve the care they provide.

"1) Medicaid must provide a streamlined system for medical practices to use: Reduce bureaucratic hurdles. Our practice cannot deal with 15 different sets of billing and authorization rules.
2) Medicaid must provide for fair, timely payment to healthcare providers: We take caring for children seriously. But we are also a business and we need to be paid fairly and on time to make payroll, buy supplies, make rent-- all the things that it takes to run a business.
3) Medicaid needs CCNC: Community Care of NC is a nonprofit organization that helps Medicaid function better in NC. CCNC cares about working with medical practices to improve care.

"I am a pediatrician in Moore County, NC. We take care of over 11,000 children with Medicaid. Our community-based care coordinator in our practice has been a valuable resource when trying to manage complicated or noncompliant patients or those with chaotic home lives. She helps make sure medicines are filled on time, fills pill boxes for families who get confused about medications, and does home visits- all of which help avoid expensive hospitalizations or disease flares. I have reviewed the proposed 1115 Waiver proposal of the NC Department of Health and Human Services. I am opposed to your approving this waiver because I do not think private insurance companies can successfully reinvent Community Care. If our practice has to deal with up to 15 different payers, this is going to result in significantly higher overhead in terms of administrative staff time. Our practice is currently using our resources to expand our integrated mental health services. This will suffer if there is increased burden and delay in getting Medicaid reimbursement. We currently do not restrict the number of medicaid patients our practice cares for but the proposed system will likely force us to decrease our medicaid percentage which will restrict care options for children in our area.

"North Carolina needs to expand Medicaid coverage to close the gap for people with extremely low incomes. Without this coverage, their health deteriorates to the point that they need more drastic and expensive medical treatment rather than receiving primary care. At this point, primary care for uninsured people in poverty is rare, provided by charities if at all. I am on the board of directors for one of these clinics where we have to fundraise to cover $200 cost per visit--but save hospital Emergency Departments $1500-$2000. The hospital then passes those costs for uninsured patients on as higher insurance rates. Our clinic also integrates medical and mental health care with community initiatives to promote wellness, like community gardens for better nutrition and healthy homes assessments for asthma triggers and prevention of falls. That is the kind of Medicaid Reform that NC needs! Please require the North Carolina legislature and governor to expand Medicaid before considering a waiver.",209869,15 Jul 2016 12:03:41

Without continued Medicaid reimbursement for the services provided in our school-based health centers, many of our centers would not be able to continue to operate and to provide the services needed to our NC children and adolescents. Despite having medical homes on record, many youth do not access care through their medical home and only receive the services rendered by the school-based health centers. This fact is true for urban, semi-urban, and rural counties. Many barriers (including family issues, transportation issues, and other social determinants of health) impede receiving care through the medical home. School-based health centers provide a comfortable and convenient location in which students can receive services, and school-based health centers routinely communicate with the medical home to ensure coordination of care for patients. School-based health center services reduce health disparities and increase access to much needed care for our NC children and adolescents.",209945,15 Jul 2016 15:53:59
"As the parent of a disabled adult that receives Medicaid I do not support the Medicaid reforms as proposed by NC.
NC Medicaid already does not provide access to adequate services for example; physical therapy and glasses. These services were covered in the past. Thus state recipients are already seeing reduced services and further capitation will only reduce covered services to recipients.
By privatizing medicaid administration to for profit entities, a greater portion of funds will now go for administrative costs and will further reduce services for recipients.
There are already many service areas within the state that provide good access to services for recipients. No new service systems need to be created, especially those that are for-profit entities.
Instead of revising Medicaid as proposed, the state should be expanding Medicaid coverage to low income individuals who are ineligible for ACA access, and sufficient money should be allocated to the Medicaid system for recipients to receive adequate health care services.",209949,15 Jul 2016 15:57:59

"As a certified pediatric health professional in NC, I care for many recipients of the NC Medicaid program. I have reviewed the proposed 1115 Waiver proposal of the NC Department of Health and Human Services and am opposed to this plan because private insurance companies have not supported many of our program. We have many school-based health centers in North Carolina who provide MUCH needed health care services to children. They come from low income and economically depressed counties and would not have received the needed services if school-based health centers did not exist. Issues such as transportation, parents unable to leave their jobs to take their children to the PCP, lack of healthcare coverage and/or monetary funds are reasons these children lack the services they need. Our school-based centers are located where these children spend the greater part of the day…at school. With parental consent the majority of their comprehensive health care needs are met in the school-based centers. Most of our centers are not the medical home for these children. We work in coordination with approval from their PCP's to provide these services. Under Community Care, we deal with one payer who recognizes the services provided and allows credentialed school-based centers to seek reimbursement from Medicaid. The 1115 Wavier only allows reimbursement for the ""medical home"". Without Medicaid reimbursement many of our centers would have to close their doors.

"As a family doctor at a community health center, I feel strongly that the legislature does not need to ""reform"" Medicaid. Bringing in private entities is likely to increase, not decrease, costs.
The one thing that the North Carolina legislature and Gov. McCrory could do to improve Medicaid is to approve Medicaid expansion. It would help patients, doctors, and communities.

My heart breaks as I watch these family docs who desire nothing more than to help care for their patients but feel helpless when they are blocked by the obstacles of our broken healthcare system. There is nothing more frustrating then to feel like you have the skills and training to help someone, but are deterred because of the system. Consider how the denial of Medicaid expansion in NC will affect the retention rate of medical students in NC. I will be choosing my residency program in a few short years, and this issue is the main reason why I would look outside of NC.

Particularly, CCNC has been an important part of patient care and offers the best support for patient care. The change to multiple MCOs make the system more complicated and potentially lowers already marginal reimbursement for providers taking care of our pediatric patients, the majority of Medicaid recipients. The cost trend per Medicaid patient in NC has steadily decreased under the current construct and it is highly likely to increase in the proposed changes. Furthermore, the majority of pediatric providers in NC currently accept patients with Medicaid and the number of providers willing to take Medicaid patients would likely dwindle under the proposed changes, thereby limiting access to primary care providers.

"Commenters have expressed concern about many key areas of the proposed model, to which DHHS deferred definitive declaration of intent. Rather, DHHS stated that the issue raised will be addressed ""during program development."" While it appears that some stakeholders will be given the opportunity to contribute ideas after a demonstration is approved, it's not clear how they will be selected, in what role(s) they will serve, or whether any stakeholder will have additional opportunity for additional public comment on any program design issue.

Public comment by any interested party is an important part of an environmental scan. It also demands a formal, timely, and public response. There is nothing in this waiver that promises that future public comment will be opened on all aspects of future program design, and if the demonstration is approved, CMS is certainly under no obligation to provide oversight of the public comment/response cycle.

DHHS concedes that ""many of the comments were related to implementation issues and will be addressed during program development."" Questions about payment structure, number of networks, auto-enrollment and open enrollment period, etc. -- so-called ""implementation issues"" -- are not micro-issues; they're key to the success or failure of any healthcare delivery system. Mechanisms for oversight of MCOs are certainly not peripheral here. It is reasonable for NC healthcare providers to expect answers, or at least declarations of general intent, before agreeing to support such a radical overhaul of health care financing in their state. Although DHHS has stated repeatedly it wants to engage stakeholders, it has opted to defer speaking to these devil-filled details until after CMS approves the waiver.

In my state's managed Medicaid program, I have seen countless examples of rules being approved too generally and leaving ""the details"" ""till later"" with frustrating, non-transparent, contradictory results.

CMS should require that comments that multiple stakeholders asked about key issues should be addressed at an appropriate level of detail -- before this demonstration application is considered complete.

"Dear CMS:
I am writing to share my significant concerns with the Medicaid change that has been proposed for North Carolina. I do not believe the term ""reform"" is appropriate because I dispute the notion that we have anything other than an exemplary program for children in NC. I am mystified by the assertion that NC Medicaid is broken- slide 13 of DMA presentation to the JLOC on 2/9/16 shows the PMPM cost continuing to drop. It makes no sense to abandon this winning program.

I am a general Pediatrician at Sandhills Pediatrics in Southern Pines, Seven Lakes and Raeford NC and am one of the managing partners. I am also the elected Chair of the Section on Administration on Practice Management (SOAPM) of the American Academy of Pediatrics. I am also on the Board of the NC Pediatric Society, but it is important to note that in this letter I am speaking on behalf of myself and my practice only.

It is critical for all children in NC that we ""get this right""- Children account for a over 70% of patients in Medicaid but a minority of Medicaid costs. Most pediatric practices have 20-80% medicaid. A few weeks of non payment on that significant a percentage of patients will bankrupt pediatric practices quickly, leaving even privately insured children without pediatric care.

I completed my Pediatric residency in Memphis,Tennessee and was able to see the dysfunction of Tenncare up close. The Children's Hospital was part of all the Tenncare plans, but I struggled on a regular basis to find in-network specialists for my clinic patients.

I fully understand that DMA has to comply with the law that was passed and I very much appreciate the hard work of the excellent employees at DMA whom I very much respect.

DMA and CMS are being asked to ""square a circle"" to decrease provider hassle and complexity by creating a system with potentially 15 different Medicaid payors. Patients are mobile- we often see children who move from one part of the state to the other in informal guardianship, sometimes with an aunt or grandparent. We will end up dealing with all 15 payors no matter what the wishful thinking is, unless we refuse to see new patients who have a medicaid MCO we aren't signed up with and dump them on the ER (which dramatically increases cost). Currently our practice sees new medicaid patients all the time, even in difficult family situations.

Please do NOT approve this waiver! Children need to be left out of this mess!

"Dear CMS,
I noted that the first comment to the North Carolina Medicaid waiver was a plea from an administrator at a Federally Qualified Health Center to develop special provisions for their expected increase in patients. As a pediatrician practicing in Eastern North Carolina in a clinic that serves 7300 children on Medicaid foresee a shift away from their current pediatric medical home into FQHCs as the increased administrative burden and the expected decrease in reimbursements force practices such as my own to limit caring for children with Medicaid. A FQHC's costs per patient are 30% greater than current Medicaid payments to my ""private"" clinic. I am proud of the high quality, financially efficient care I provide all the families under my care. Any primary care savings through the North Carolina Medicaid waiver will be partially offset by the CMS direct subsidy to FQHCs. The cost shifting to CMS from the state Medicaid budget by the projected greater use of federally qualified health clinics needs to be included when making decisions about the section 1115 waiver.

"To Whom It May Concern:

I did all of my medical/surgical training in California, between 1986 and 1995. I then practiced pediatric surgery in California full-time, from 1995 through 1999. Roughly 40% of my patients were receiving California Medicaid.

California underwent a change in Medicaid similar to what has been proposed in North Carolina, with a type of ""privatization"" of the plan. At that time, this was referred to as ""Medicaid Managed Care."" Multiple reports and studies have documented the disruption of pediatric specialty care that resulted--unfortunately, the private companies that agreed to collaborate with the State of California to administer the plan found that they needed ""administrative costs"" for such services. As a result, physician reimbursement for medical/surgical services (provided to California Medicaid patients) decreased by about 20%. In addition, multiple different plans made the hassle/paperwork factor so burdensome (and expensive) to many pediatric specialists that they were forced to stop providing care to these patients--unfortunately, pediatric specialist office overhead expenses was too high.

Since so few specialists could afford to provide care to these children, my personal experience was that these kids tended to be denied care until their conditions/diseases became advanced/severe. Families with kids in need found it extremely difficult (if not impossible) to provide specialty providers who would take California Medicaid.

In my opinion, this California Medicaid ""experiment"" was a huge failure (and is one of the reasons I ultimately left California and moved to North Carolina). I am very concerned that our North Carolina legislators may repeat the mistakes of the California system. I have yet to see clear-cut specific clear rules/regulations/guidelines in the proposed North Carolina system that will prevent us from having a California-type mess.

Thanks for reading this. (These comments represent my personal opinions and may not reflect those of my employer.)

Even with a government supplement through ""Obamacare"", we are going bankrupt! Being unemployed, we would have qualified for medicaid in every state where Medicaid was expanded, but not in NC. We are almost at the end of our rope!

I am a cancer survivor and have been unable to go for my annual cancer screening - blood tests, and occasional scan - because we simply cannot afford the extra payments out of pocket. Even if my cancer reappeared, I could not afford treatment.

Our youngest daughter is disabled but does not qualify for medicaid. We provide her care and are quickly getting to the point where I have no idea how we will pay for her medication much less doctors' visits.

Our story is sad but not unique. Too many families once in the middle class are slipping further and further behind in spite of our best efforts to stay abreast. Not having to pay thousands of dollars in health care every year would be a huge help to those of us caught in the health care hole and unable to crawl out.

"My name is Mike Villareal, MD and I do not support this waiver and recommended changes.

Expansion of medicaid in NC, accepting more federal dollars to support the system, would IMPROVE access and care in NC FAR more than current recommendations in the waiver. NC has not chosen to do that thus far.

CCNC has been a well established program, that has over the past few years saved money and improved access to care for children in NC… Elimination of this program will reverse this trend

This is going to be a disaster for access for patients in North Carolina in both rural and urban populations.

90% of pediatricians currently accept medicaid in NC, which pays 75% medicare rates. Further reduction in reimbursement, which will likely happen, to rates 50-60% of what private payers currently pay would lead to pediatricians not accepting medicaid, and lead to a lack of access of patients who will get their care at emergency rooms, driving up the cost of healthcare overall. CCNC in NC has improved tremendously care being delivered in the medical home, not in Emergency or urgent care environments, saving the system money.

Current budget for medicaid has 6% for administration. Waiver includes 12%, as ""for profit"" companies will need to have an operating margin. This extra 6% will likely lead to reductions in reimbursement for physicians, which will lead them to discontinue taking medicaid patients.

There is great concerns that with so many options for patients (up to 15) that those options that primary care pediatricians will accept may be different than what specialists will use, which will make referrals to needed specialists difficult to impossible.

this is not the right kind of waiver, bent on specifics for innovation for improved quality of care and access, which is already well above standard in the US, and this current waiver would NOT reach these goals.

Going from one unified medicaid systems to 12-15 different MCOs. There is no need to have that many in a state our size, with population or geographic size. Tennessee, which is similar geographically and in population, had 4.

Transparency of current medicaid system, for communication and expectations, is BETTER than private insurance. Increased number of medicaid MCOs, with different rules, different formularies, and with an eye towards their own profit, will increase physician and office time in determining approved medications, and getting authorization for needed services.",210133,17 Jul 2016 12:48:07
"Medicaid expansion should not be seen as a burden on taxpayers, but rather as key to enhancing the economic well-being of the citizens whether or not they are direct beneficiaries of this policy. It ultimately benefits everyone and everyone's health to have affordable access to healthcare. Having Medicaid expansion provides a more positive economic climate for the State, making it more attractive to employers to establish and expand business in the State. When there are sound policies and programs that promote basic needs of the citizenry such as in the fields of health and education, there is a strong foundation for economic growth. Young families are attracted to areas perceived as providing services that ensure and enhance quality of life.

"I have been a physician in North Carolina providing gastrointestinal disease services to both children and adults since 1978. I strongly oppose the new Medicaid reform proposals outlined above. I urge you to continue CCNC Medicaid program presently providing access for our most vulnerable patients, our children, while minimizing cost per patient by allowing patients access to lower cost office care rather than ER visits , while decreasing administrative costs to approximately 6 percent. For profit involvement will increase administrative costs and the need for return on investment for stockholders. More importantly I believe it will drive pediatricians who see as many as 30 to 70 percent of their patients as Medicaid receipients, especially in rural NC to close or severely limit access to the detriment of our children, driving up ER visits and costs to the system unnecessarily.
This bill is a bad idea, will decrease access and increase costs and will add unnecessary administrative paperwork and inefficiency as well.

"I am a primary care physician practicing fulltime in a charity-run, safety-net facility that serves only the uninsured (ie none have Medicaid). Every day, I witness the major deficit (even danger) with the current Medicaid: its failure to enroll non-disabled adults even with critically low income.

North Carolina Medicaid is already delivering quality services in a single-payer, state-run program that includes ambitious monitoring and assessment of outcomes through a provider-developed network, Community Care of North Carolina.

The NC Legislature and Administration's cost motives (of controlling expenditures through competing networks delivering systematic and coordinated services) has actually already been achieved, with one of the lowest per-patient cost-expanding Medicaid in the country.

The most serious deficiency in current Medicaid is the failure to enroll 300,00-500,000 of the state's low-income, non-disabled non-Seniors, many of whom have serious ongoing health needs, out of reach to their current wages. Any modification of the state's Medicaid needs to include an Expansion of those eligible to enroll for coverage.

Choosing to privatize and capitate service-delivery is entirely ideological, counting on a system which will include MORE overhead (including marketing and profits). If this waiver is to be accepted, there needs to be a simultaneous agreement to expand enrollment to those current unable to participate in ANY of the ACA's programs.

"I am a practicing pediatrician in NC for the past 19 years. CCNC has created a statewide medical home model for pediatrics that has resulted in tremendous cost savings with reduction in PMPM costs and improved patient outcomes. The delivery of care for Medicaid beneficiaries in NC by CCNC has earned national accolades and has been a model for other states. To dismantle what has been achieved and create a new delivery system will disrupt gains and likely increase overall costs. The major impact will be felt by community pediatricians who will not be able to sustain the additional decrease in physician payments in the guise of a capitated system. It will be extremely difficult to earn any potential bonus payments and we are likely to see many pediatricians leave creating a vacuum in many parts of the state in particular the more rural communities. This is also at a time when physician stress and burnout is at an all time high. Privatizing and allowing commercial entities to compete will further hurt and stress the pediatric providers resulting in attrition and ultimately a decrease in access, quality and outcomes. The management costs for the Medicaid program (PMPM) has consistently been one of the lowest in the nation in the current system. I as a representative of over 10 pediatric providers in Onslow County would like to voice a strong objection to the Reform proposal submitted. It is a horrible idea.

"It is extremely important to expand Medicaid in our state to those made most vulnerable by poverty and inadequate access to the opportunities they need to get ahead (ex. quality public education, fair hiring practices, lack of assets and familial wealth.) Note that we can and should close the coverage gap in NC. Not only is the the morale thing to do, it makes complete economic sense. It is unacceptable that any Medicaid reform plan in our state would not address the need to close the coverage gap. Healthy people have better mental health, better birth outcomes, better chances at a long and productive life. This is a statement backed up by evidence which we simply cannot ignore. As someone with strong understanding of public health research and extensive work experience collaborating with historically disenfranchised communities to increase access to healthcare, I ask that you please take these comments seriously and make a good-faith effort to close the coverage gap in our state. As a former case manager with Duke Hospital in Durham, NC I remember one case in particular that highlights the way in which healthcare can save lives. Darnell (name changed) came to our program stating he had been feeling very sick and rapidly losing weight. He went to several emergency rooms throughout the state only to be turned away with minimal screening and told to establish with a PCP. Too poor to find the money to obtain a primary care appointment at the local FQHC, Darnell, a single male who did not quality for Medicaid in North Carolina, finally was admitted to the hospital several months later with late-stage colon cancer. He was dying when I left that job and I could not help but think about the way in which our failure to close the coverage gap and offer him access to basic primary care services could have perhaps saved his life or at least delayed the rapidity with which his cancer ravaged his body. These are the stories that data and number fail to tell the American public, for if more people new what closing the coverage gap actually meant for their community, more people would be speaking up.

"I am the mother of a 42 year old adult with Autism. When my son was 21 he became an award of the state of North Carolina and I became his legal guardian. He lives in an ICFMR facility that relies upon Medicaid funding for his total care; his portion of Social Security Disability is not any place near sufficient to cover his total medical and problematic needs as well as medical and psycho-social needs. I am a taxpayer and have been my entire life. Medicaid is not a program just for poor people but it supports the elderly, people with disabilities, and over a half million people who fall within the poverty line. North Carolina made it a law that my son would become their responsibility and as a parent, I am expecting my state to match it's commitment to people with disabilities and all those who qualify for Medicaid services. The tax forgiveness from the Federal Government makes it pliable for North Carolina to treat its citizens with the same consideration it allows tax advantages for industries to locate to our state's business/economic infrastructure with tax free amenities. The difference is that private companies are not obligated to remain in our state even when given the tax advantages. People born with physical disabilities, poor, and those who live to be elderly--a large portion of our state's population should not have to suffer when it comes to medical and supportive services they are entitled to because our state see's these individuals' critical needs as a tax burden rather than a tax responsibility. I am encouraging North Carolina policymakers to legislate quality of life for people like my son and countless others who did not opt to be born with physical disabilities or mental handicaps just as no one elects to be born into poverty as a pre-requisite to being born or becoming a citizen of the Old North State where the Living is anything but great for well over 500,000 citizens, many of who have Autism just as my son does and relies heavily upon Medicaid funding for his basic survival needs and medical needs.

"To whom it may concern:
I am a 53 year-old general pediatrician, and have been in private practice in Asheville, NC for 25 years. I would like to state that there is NO REASON TO CONTINUE WITH THE CURRENT PLAN FOR MEDICAID REFORM. I have several serious concerns:
1) The current program run by CCNC has been working well. We have had the smallest growth in medicaid costs in our entire country.
2) The privatization of NC medicaid administration WILL BE MORE EXPENSIVE! CCNC has functioned with an overhead cost of 6%. Private insurers would be permitted to pay up to 12% for overhead. Also, these are for-profit companies that by definition will be expected by their stakeholders to profit from this venture.
3) Privatizing Medicaid WILL BE AN ADMINISTRATIVE NIGHTMARE! Both medicaid and our private payers have been a nightmare to collect from. Witness the experience with NC Tracks, and also remember that our state insurance commissioner has had to be involved this year because Blue Cross has not been paying providers for services rendered. We are STILL awaiting BCBS payments from months ago. Imagine if we now have to contend with 5 additional insurers in order to collect for our medicaid patients? Also, our medicaid patients already often have the wrong primary providers listed on their cards. What if we are forced to repeatedly bill the same encounter because we are told that a patient has been assigned to the wrong insurer??? This is incredibly costly for us!
4) Assuming that the cost of administration increases with the use of private insurers, who will bear the cost of the increases? Assuming that our legislature won't allocate any additional funding, and that patients won't be dropped from the medicaid rolls, then the only answer is that providers will face yet ANOTHER fee cut. We already receive less for our medicaid patients than we did in 2004, have the highest percentage of medication patients, and earn less than any other medical specialty. To cut our pay even further would be intolerable. I'm sure no legislature or legislative staffers would tolerate earning less than they did in the same job 12 years ago.
In summary, There is no good reason to make this change, unless current lawmakers are inappropriately influenced by insurance companies, or are ideologically determined to privatized state duties even if doing so makes absolutely no rational sense.

"As a pediatrician in NC, I am deeply concerned about the model set for in the NC proposed 1115 Waiver. In fact, although 71% of those affected are estimated to be children, the vast majority of the pediatricians providing their care do not believe it will improve child health.

About 40% of children in NC are insured through Medicaid, and children are the majority of people in NC receiving health care through Medicaid. If Medicaid reform doesn't work for children, Medicaid reform won't work.

I will continue to work as hard as I can to assure that all children, and particularly low-income children, have access to quality health care. However, pediatricians across the state are already stretched thin with recent Medicaid payment reductions, moving to EMR, implementing meaningful use and other changes in this rapidly changing medical world. I am deeply concerned about our ability to continue to deliver effective medical care as supports like CCNC are removed, specialists are harder to access, and multiple administrative and payment barriers are erected. As it gets harder, more bureaucratic, and less rewarding to care for kids, practices will become more stretched and stressed and more pediatricians will likely retire or otherwise limit serving children. Medicaid Expansion would do so much more for children and families in NC than this proposed waiver, which instead will likely limit access and make it more difficult for pediatricians to care for children.

It is the crown jewel of Medicaid programs in the US and has saved the federal and state government millions of dollars in health care costs. The Medicaid system starting setting up Patient Centered Medical Homes in the 1990s before they were even called Patient Centered Medical Homes. Roughly 90% of the indigent populations in NC have primary care physicians. The cost over runs in the Medicaid program had nothing to do with the patient part of the program and the physicians who managed those patients yet the state legislature decided to create a hybrid system allowing the managed care industry to have access to the system. The more cynical of us felt this was payment for the millions of dollars the managed care industry contributed to Republican campaigns over the last 6 years. This application is a bad idea and I would predict many physicians will opt out of the program if it is enacted. Managed care companies typically squeeze out their ""pound of flesh"" by lowering physician fees to levels which no longer cover our over head costs. I would encourage you not to approve this legislation. Allen Dobson is the director of the CCNC and a personal friend. We have worked together for years to make this system what it is today. The IT system created for Medicaid is a model the rest of the nation could follow.

Despite the 99% negative comments received, the waiver was not materially changed! That should tell CMS that the state is unwilling or not allowed by the legislature to design a program that is equal to what we have! We are certain our payments will go down below the current 76% of Medicare and managing 5 to 15 Medicaid Companies all with different rules will be an administrative nightmare!.
With our current CCNC program, we have a substantial ""buy-in"" from physicians - especially pediatricians. ""Buy-in"" is required for a cost-effective successful program. This proposed program will be neither.

"Dear CMS,

I am writing in regards to my concern about children's access to their pediatrician should this Waiver be approved. I chose to work in North Carolina because it is a place where I can see all the children in the community. When I talked to pediatricians elsewhere either you work in a practice that takes private insurance or you work in a ""Medicaid"" clinic. In my clinic in New Bern we are privileged to see children with Medicaid alongside children with private insurance. Most children with Medicaid and North Carolina are seen in private practices like ours. Medicaid pays substantially less per visit. This is partly offset by the lower cost of claims management due to 1 payer with consistent policies and payment schedule. The waiver plan will have us contracting with at least 5 different managed Medicaid organizations. Each will have a different claims management policy. Most Medicaid managed care companies, from what my colleagues tell me in other states, give them the same headaches as private insurance. Lower reimbursement rates and elevated claims management expenses will require us to limit our Medicaid exposure in order to remain solvent.

Our sickest children are on Medicaid- it pains me to contemplate choosing between their welfare and being able to pay my staff. Our practice, like most pediatric practices, exists on a very slim margin. I work in North Carolina because through my residency and professional career the Pediatric Society, Community Care North Carolina and the Department of Health and Human Services all pulled together to create the best care we can for the children of our state. This waiver, whether on purpose or by accident, is designed to destroy the pediatric medical home as it has been developed for the last 30 years.

"I am a Pediatrician and have been caring for NC children for 36 years. I have readily accepted these patients for the reduced fees given for their care.I do not support this waiver and recommended changes….

Expansion of medicaid in NC, accepting more federal dollars to support the system, would IMPROVE access and care in NC FAR more than current recommendations in the waiver. NC has not chosen to do that thus far.

CCNC has been a well established program, that has over the past few years saved money and improved access to care for children in NC… Elimination of this program will reverse this trend

This is going to be a disaster for access for patients in North Carolina in both rural and urban populations.

90% of pediatricians currently accept medicaid in NC, which pays 75% medicare rates. Further reduction in reimbursement, which will likely happen, to rates 50-60% of what private payers currently pay would lead to pediatricians not accepting medicaid, and lead to a lack of access of patients who will get their care at emergency rooms, driving up the cost of healthcare overall. CCNC in NC has improved tremendously care being delivered in the medical home, not in Emergency or urgent care environments, saving the system money.

"As a pediatrician in NC for the last 36 years and a provider for the most vulnerable group of children, Medicaid enrollees, I have tremendous concern for this proposed waiver to our current system.

Current budget for medicaid has 6% for administration. Waiver includes 12%, as ""for profit"" companies will need to have an operating margin. This extra 6% will likely lead to reductions in reimbursement for physicians, which will lead them to discontinue taking medicaid patients.

There is great concerns that with so many options for patients (up to 15) that those options that primary care pediatricians will accept may be different than what specialists will use, which will make referrals to needed specialists difficult to impossible.

This is not the right kind of waiver, bent on specifics for innovation for improved quality of care and access, which is already well above standard in the US, and this current waiver would NOT reach these goals.

Going from one unified medicaid systems to 12-15 different MCOs. There is no need to have that many in a state our size, with population or geographic size. Tennessee, which is similar geographically and in population, had 4.

transparency of current medicaid system, for communication and expectations, is BETTER than private insurance. Increased number of medicaid MCOs, with different rules, different formularies, and with an eye towards their own profit, will increase physician and office time in determining approved medications, and getting authorization for needed services.

"I am a general pediatrician in Eastern NC who provides care for children, most of whom have Medicaid for their health insurance.

I urge you to reject the waiver put forth by NC legislators to completely obliterate and ruin our successful Medicaid program and keep our current Medicaid & CCNC program. In consideration of this waiver, you must consider a few things:

1. There is not a practicing physician who thinks this waiver would serve our population well. If Medicaid in NC is taken over by a variety of private insurance companies, it would be a disaster-- not only for the families to navigate but also for the providers. This added complication to working with several different private companies would lead to much worse access to care for our poorest families and children.

2. CCNC is a great program. It is a success and dismantling it makes NO sense. It would be irresponsible and NC would not be able to re-create such a successful program in the next 25 years. Losing our school based health centers in our highest poverty schools would also be likely with this waiver. That would be devastating to our school age children who benefit every day from these services, both physical health and mental health.

3. Legislators should realize that Medicaid is going to cost substantially MORE if this waiver is accepted. There will be more people accessing emergency services, which are VERY EXPENSIVE compared to office visits. As a pediatrician, my colleagues and I work hard to provide continuous and high quality care to infants, children and adolescents, and to keep them out of emergency departments. If the waiver passes and NC moves forward to dismantle the Medicaid system as our NC legislators propose to do, there will be no way to keep our families out of the ER for minor medical problems. I do not think legislators are thinking of this consequence with the proposed waiver.

Thank you for NOT accepting this waiver and doing what is best for NC children and families.",210321,18 Jul 2016 07:31:05

"I am a pediatrician in North Carolina, currently working primarily in Moore County and with past experience in Orange and Guilford Counties. I have serious concerns regarding the 115 Waiver proposal of the NC Department of Health and Human Services, two of which are detailed below.

In each community, I experienced the benefit of Community Care of North Carolina (CCNC). The coordination of care through the services provided are exceptional and tailored to meet the needs of the community. A program such as this will be hard for a private company to replicate, and even harder if there are many competing entities. Just in the past few weeks for my personal subset of patients, our clinic's care coordinator helped a high-needs patient transition from hospital to home care, conducted home visits for two patients with high health care utilization, and assisted in the care of a patient with severe asthma who has had care in multiple different hospitals and clinics throughout the state.

Our practice sees over 11,000 patients who receive Medicaid. The complications that will inevitably arise from having 15 separate payers will force our practice to make major changes, potentially freezing wages, forgoing hiring for needed positions, or decreasing the number of Medicaid patients we can see. In any of these scenarios, we will not be able to provide the best care for our patients, and the children of North Carolina will be the ones who suffer.",210341,18 Jul 2016 07:52:38
" -People in the health care gap get sick and need care, just like us the rest of us, and they must either go without care, including preventive and primary care, or rely on community health centers, or charity clinics; and then when things get super serious, they end up in the ER, which as we all know is the most expensive care. Health care access and equity should be the cornerstones of any reform plan.

The federal government has already set the money aside to pay for expansion, providing never less than 90% of the cost. Right now, our dollars are going to expand Medicaid in other states--states in which the results of expansion have already met or exceeded the estimates of outcomes: better access to care, earlier diagnoses for chronic conditions, overall cost savings, job creations, lower premiums, etc. It's an affordable, proven approach.",210345,18 Jul 2016 07:56:11

"I am a parent of a child on CAP/C. She receives Medicaid through CAP/C. Many parts of this waiver are very concerning. The most important thing in healthcare is freedom of choice of providers. This plan does not ensure we will retain that choice. It divides the states into regions & limits participants to receiving care not only in their region but also to those providers who choose to participate in their plan. With so many plans providers will have to deal with, it is likely that many will just opt out of Medicaid altogether or only take one plan. Billing multiple plans is a hassle most will not want to deal with. I am wry concerned for people like my medically fragile daughter that their lives will be put in jeopardy because the providers most skilled in her rare disease are outside of our region & may also be out of her plan. She has so many specialists, it is not likely that all will participate in the same plan. This is further complicated by limitations of her primary care insurance network. We'd have to go to one in-network w/ our primary, but what if that provider was not also in her Medicaid plan network? In addition, unclear whether NC HIPP (NC's healthcare premium assistance program) will still be available. Without it, many families like mine with huge medical bills & expenses may have to drop our child's primary health insurance bc we can't afford the premiums.

"North Carolina's Medicaid reform plan lacks the most important change needed to improve health care for North Carolinians and strengthen the provider community — Medicaid expansion! Medicaid coverage should be extended to all adults ages 18-64 with incomes at or below 138% of the Federal Poverty Level (FPL). In North Carolina, expanded Medicaid would cover more than 400,000 people; at least 244,000 of those in the Coverage Gap are uninsured as a result.

In 2014, 43% of all community health center patients in North Carolina were uninsured and more than 70% of patients lived at or below 100% FPL. Community health center staff see firsthand the significant health challenges and barriers to needed services that these uninsured and low-income patients face. In North Carolina, nearly 40,000 women are not receiving recommended preventive screenings, 27,044 diabetics cannot get much needed medications, and 45,500 individuals with depression are not getting the treatment they need. In fact, providers often have to modify treatment plans for uninsured patients because of their inability to afford a specialist visit or pay for needed medications.

With Medicaid expansion, community health centers in North Carolina could better coordinate the full spectrum of care their patients need. Medicaid expansion would also bring new income to the community health centers that would enable them to expand sites and services, hire new staff, and integrate and improve the care they provide.

We are currently getting less than Medicare rates for care of these patients. Already this is inadequate to cover overhead and operation costs. Current reimbursement is not adequate to cover salary of our physicians which we fortunately can supplement from the reimbursement from our commercial insurance companies.

In my opinion, the current waiver is DANGEROUS AND IRRESPONSIBLE. As proposed, we would need to significantly increase overhead if we have to deal with many different companies that will handle insurance claims and also deal with different formularies, networks, etc. THIS WOULD BE AN ADMINISTRATIVE NIGHTMARE.

"I am a practice administrator for a 10 provider, private pediatric practice in western North Carolina. 60% of our patients are Medicaid recipients. We have been well served by the current Access Care Program that manages care coordination and payment for services. Their case management services have been invaluable, as many of these kids have significant health and behavior problems that are difficult to manage by the physician alone. They frequently need outreach for other issues like parenting, transportation, and compliance. Pediatrics is a very labor intensive speciality and many resources are needed to provide quality healthcare. Recent cuts in the Medicaid program in North Carolina have caused financial burdens to practices that have been heretofore unseen. This year, $154 million was returned to the NC General fund from the Medicaid program as a result of savings realized. This was done at the expense of physicians who are caring for the next generation of adults.

We functioned best when we were receiving 100% of Medicare reimbursement. The transition to managed care leaves so many unanswered questions about how we will be reimbursed, and what sort of care coordination and management will be available that we have no idea what to expect. Multiple meetings that we attended on the subject with various politicians left us with more questions than answers.

It appears to me that our current governor is selling us out to develop connections to the big insurance companies that will line the pockets of the politicians instead of making sure North Carolina's kids get the care they deserve.

It will be extremely difficult and time-consuming to practices to dispute claims, affecting cash flow to a great extent.

"I am a pediatrician in a large group practice that sees patients that have Medicaid. I am very concerned about the proposed changes to NC's Medicaid plan. Other states that have privatized, for profit companies, managing their Medicaid have not had a good experience at all. This would likely also involved capitation which would be a huge disincentive for providers to take Medicaid patients. In addition, dealing with 15 different insurance companies with different metrics would be tedious and difficult to manage for practices and also difficult for patients. Thank you, Bridget, Degele, MD",210537,18 Jul 2016 11:26:18
"I am an outpatient pediatrician in Wake Forest, NC. I love caring for our state's children and am concerned about the proposed changes for Medicaid and how they will impact the access to care and coordination of care for my Medicaid population. In other states that have privatized Medicaid services, there have been struggles for both the patient and the physician to know what services are covered and how to be reimbursed for providing those services. CCNC is a very successful program and disbanding it is the wrong thing to do if you evaluate the data. CCNC helps us provide quality coordinated care that helps keep costs down. Dealing with 15 different insurance companies, all with different metrics and formularies, would be almost impossible to manage. With the help of the CCNC program, we now have imbedded mental health in one of our offices which has been a great benefit to our vulnerable Medicaid population. We plan to expand this to other offices, but if Medicaid is taken over by private insurance, this might not be possible.

Again, please reconsider this privatization of Medicaid and disbandment of CCNC.

Sincerely,

"I am a practice manager at a pediatric ophthalmologist office. I am not in favor of positioning NC Medicaid to be managed by a third party, for profit organization especially under the claim that it will provide ""better care"" to its recipients. We have a strong relationships with our local pediatricians and most all offices that refer to us. They do outstanding work to provide medical homes through the CCNC program.
Bringing in a for profit agency may indeed result in less money spent by North Carolina (for a year or so) but given that they will strive to make a profit that will mean that less money is actually going to the care of the patient.
Children (those under age 18) in the NC Medicaid program are not the most expensive ones to take care of, yet they could pay the biggest price in the proposed changes. Perhaps looking to the high expense areas (nursing care, durable medical equipment) for reform could lend the best financial payback for the state.
As a specialty provider, we have seen vision care cast aside by the major carriers for many years. Even with ACA efforts in pediatric vision coverage, it has been a nightmare of hoops and red tape to provide basic, needed care for children. The NC Medicaid system has had some ups and downs with our specialty but the current system works and children benefit. Our practice is dominated by Medicaid patients and introducing changes that may inhibit our ability to provide acceptable standards of care could prevent us from going forward as an available provider.
This is our passion. You do not go into pediatric ophthalmology to make tons of money, but you do have to sustain yourself.",210549,18 Jul 2016 11:37:16

It makes since to stick with what works, even though we do have a few issues, it would be better to fix them than create more with a more complicated system.

I am a pediatrician in North Carolina and I am opposed to the waiver.

Please say no to the waiver,210561,18 Jul 2016 12:00:20
"NC Medicaid and CCNC has been nationally recognized for its success and breaking down this model might do more good than harm. Moreover, with recent medicaid cuts, access to care has been significantly compromised with many private offices no longer accepting medicaid patients or have had to close down due to lack of financial sustainability. This in turn has increased the burden on emergency rooms which is a major contributor to rising healthcare costs. Hence, we urge you to revise provider
reimbursement rates and ensure they are comparable to Medicare rates to ensure access to care. I strongly urge you to place your focus where it is needed which is Medicaid expansion not reform . Thank you",210565,18 Jul 2016 12:02:37

"CMS - Please deny this disaster of a waiver!
I am a pediatrician in NC and belong to a large practice with 1/3 Medicaid patients.
I went to one of the ""public comment sessions"" held by NC DMA at several locations around the state to satisfy CMS's requirement that they solicit comments. Many of the comments were from pediatricians and ALL were asking the state NOT to kill the Nation's Best Medicaid program. I've learned that the same comments were made at all sessions across the state..
Despite the 99% negative comments received, the waiver was not materially changed! That should tell CMS that the state is unwilling or not allowed by the legislature to design a program that is equal to what we have! We are certain our payments will go down below the current 76% of Medicare and managing 5 to 15 Medicaid Companies all with different rules will be an administrative nightmare!.
With our current CCNC program, we have a substantial ""buy-in"" from physicians - especially pediatricians. ""Buy-in"" is required for a cost-effective successful program. This proposed program will be neither.
We currently have a cost effective program with an 8% reduction in PMPM over the past 5 years! Once the state loses the trust of the physicians - and that can happen in a single year of a dysfunctional program - it will take years to regain what we have now!
I understand a state has the right to totally implode their indigent healthcare system - but this time they need CMS's PERMISSION to do so! Just say ""NO!"" to this terrible ""solution"" to a non-existent problem! Or at least exclude the pediatric population from this disaster in the making! Pediatrics is NOT broken!
Please deny this waiver and save our Medicaid Program.

"Dear CMS,
I was living and working in Northern Virginia when MCO's took over all Medicaid specialty care, it was a disaster! It took 3 times as long to precertify surgical procedures, MRI's, Cat Scans, etc and our reimbursements tanked by 30%! Unpaid claims rose by 25% to 35%. We had to fight claims denials for reimbursements and I finally threatened legal action to retrieve payments that were 24 to 36 months old. I finally received a check for 12k + for non-paid claims after fighting the MCO for 48 months. And, to add further insult and injury, the MCO folded not long after so we still lost money for claims that had not been processed and paid!
Wake up CMS! Do not further burden pediatricians and reduce our receivables even further, Pediatricians are being put out of business!

"As a pediatrician practicing in rural north carolina, I am shocked that the legislature think dividing medicaid up into multiple entities is going to produce a better product for the children on North Carolina. Just stop and think about it. Each entity will have its own employees, accountants, CEO, infrastructure, and overhead, etc. These entities will be trying to make a profit. Most of these expenses will be duplicated between entities. As the medicaid pie is not growing, how on earth are these increase expenses going to be paid for? Let me tell you, by limiting services to the medicaid recipient and further decreasing reimbursement to those who provide services to the medicaid patients. The increase bureaucracy created by the multiple entities will increase expenses for the practices trying to treat patients with medicaid. More staff required to get referrals authorized, get the medication approved, get the xray ordered. Each entity will have different requirements and different protocols which will create a more complex system for the providers to navigate. This cost the providers more money, while our reimbursement will continue to decrease. Many will walk away from medicaid. I can't say I will blame them.

The current system is not broken. There are many tweaks that could be made to save money. Don't blow the whole thing up and hope that what is left is going to be fertile ground. What you are going to find is a wasteland where providers will not touch medicaid and the pediatric population is hurt.",210601,18 Jul 2016 13:06:27
"As a life-long resident of North Carolina, I urge the state of North Carolina to expand Medicaid to all state residents under 138% of the federal poverty level. In order for NC Medicaid and NC Health Choice 1115 Demonstration Waiver to be truly innovative and address community health needs, the waiver should include Medicaid expansion. Without expansion, up to 500,000 North Carolinians will continue to go without access to quality, affordable health care. This year, nearly 50,000 women will not receive recommended preventive screenings, 27,000 diabetics will not be able to get necessary medications, and 144,000 children will remain uninsured because their parents lack access to coverage. Clinics and hospitals, especially in rural areas, will continue to be financially vulnerable because of uncompensated emergency room costs. If hundreds of thousands of low-income residents remain in the Coverage Gap, North Carolina cannot truly address prevention, health equity, or social determinants of health. North Carolina Medicaid reform must include Medicaid expansion.

"I believe NC's plan to reform Medicaid should include closing the coverage gap. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act was originally written to include individuals of all income levels. Those below a certain income were to receive Medicaid. When the Supreme Court ruled that states could decide whether to expand Medicaid in their state to cover those individuals, North Carolina opted not to expand the program, stating that the Medicaid system was broken and needed to be overhauled.

To date, the state of North Carolina has rejected over $4.5 billion in Federal funds which would have provided coverage to over a half million of our neighbors, family and friends. Even after three years, the state will never pay more than 10% of the cost to cover these individuals.

The most disturbing result of NC's failure to expand Medicaid is the estimated 375,000 people who have been left uninsured, even though the majority of them have jobs. According to the Cone Health Foundation, more than 1000 of them will lose their lives due to injury, disease, and chronic conditions each year without Medicaid.

In addition, four rural hospitals have already closed in our state due in large part to reduction in uncompensated care funding. Over $6 billion in federal fundin has been lost in NC in 2014 and 2015, due to failure to expand Medicaid, and estimates suggest that an additional $21 will be lost between 2016 and 2017.",210789,18 Jul 2016 15:07:28

I am certain that this will result in limitations in access for many patients.
Reimbursement is not the only goal in play with this legislation. By simply making it more difficult to gain access to care, this plan will ration care in a way that those who need the most help are likely to be the least able to navigate the new system.

The Governor has quite a nerve to submit this proposal, when failing to expand Medicaid, to further in my view bring a flawed for-profit approach to serving this population in my state. I totally oppose this reform.

"It is important that North Carolina closes the ""coverage gap"" by expanding Medicaid. As Director of Pharmacy Services for a large FQHC in central North Carolina, I see every day the difficulties imposed on the lives of patients who are unable to obtain Medicaid coverage. As an example, an uninsured diabetic patient, will usually need 5-6 medications plus diabetes testing supplies, totaling approximately $400-$500 per month. With Medicaid coverage, this patient would only have to pay small co-pays and would be assured of obtaining their medication. Without Medicaid coverage, this patient would only obtain a small amount of medication and would be a poorly controlled diabetic patient, would usually have numerous hospital admissions, and would incur extremely high medical expenses. This is a great example of the wisdom of expanding Medicaid in North Carolina. It will be extremely difficult to improve community health if 500,000 North Carolina citizens continue to go without access to needed medications to control chronic diseases such as diabetes. Expanding Medicaid in North Carolina is a must in order to improve the health of all of our citizens. Submitted by: Carl D. Taylor, Director of Pharmacy Services, Piedmont Health Services, Inc.

By turning over the management of Medicaid to for-profit Prepaid Health Plans, the waiver proposal will most likely cause costs to rise, access to fall, and quality of care to dwindle.

Requiring pediatricians to deal with multi Prepaid Health Plans will increase the administrative hassles and costs of providers, resulting in decreases in access and quality. The current Community Care of North Carolina program is a model for optimal access to care, high quality of care, cost-effective care, and efficient integration of the professionals who must collaborate to improve patient outcomes.

In order for NC Medicaid and NC Health Choice 1115 Demonstration Waiver to be truly innovative and address community health needs, the waiver should include Medicaid expansion. Without expansion, up to 500,000 North Carolinians will continue to go without access to quality, affordable health care. This year, nearly 50,000 women will not receive recommended preventive screenings, 27,000 diabetics will not be able to get necessary medications, and 144,000 children will remain uninsured because their parents lack access to coverage. Clinics and hospitals, especially in rural areas, will continue to be financially vulnerable because of uncompensated emergency room costs. If hundreds of thousands of low-income residents remain in the Coverage Gap, North Carolina cannot truly address prevention, health equity, or social determinants of health.

"The waiver is a classic Bait And Switch - Please save us and our patients from profit driven private companies.
The reason given for the waiver is not rational - the state thinks if 10+ Private Companies manage Medicaid, if there is a shortfall, the state will not owe their 30% of the cost. Not likely, and never twice in a row.The MCO's have done contracts with states before, and their lawyers will ""out gun"" the state's in the complex contract. Private companies do not exist to lose money. All they have to do is to DELAY PAYMENT for care! There is no penalty for partial payment of claims - only for non-payment. Or, just not approve care to be done or approve providers to do the care. That is what happened to our Mental Health program - the state paid on capitation and the companies figured out they could just sit on the money and they would never go ""over budget""!
Maybe for a year or two the private companies will ""lose"" money, but as soon as the state dismantles their infrastructure for handling Medicaid claims, the state will have NO option and the cost will sky-rocket up! Not hard to figure this out....

"Please save us from this disaster of a waiver request!
Capitation works best when the patient can choose to go elsewhere if the service/quality is not up to standards. Capitation is literally unsafe for Medicaid patients since they have NOWHERE to go if the quality or service deteriorates to meet the payment level! Private carriers using Capitation know if they do not insure the service is reasonable, patients will leave.
Capitation at the patient level is hard to do!
This conversion needs to start small - start with the most expensive, out of control segment - the adult Medicaid. Children 0-18y are at a great place in NC - it is very unlikely that by irritating the pediatricians by dismantling the very effective CCNC they have put so much effort into creating, they will be ""helpful"" with the new entity. The MCO's demand that the pediatric age range be included - they know our costs are much more predictable and will use ""our"" money (ie, reduce our payments) to fund efforts in the adult side to save money. Children will be punished for doing so well over the past 5 years!

I am a pediatrician from Greensboro, NC as was my father. We have always accepted Medicaid patients as freely and treated them the same as all other patients ( with private insurance).
The proposed "" reform"" of the NC Medicaid system gives great promise of being a disaster. Going from a single payer system that works to a five-payer system introduces such complexity as likely to be over whelming to patients and providers alike. Overuse of the ER, increased difficulty getting consultants to see Medicaid patients, a deterioration of care, and chaos for the medical care for poor people seems likely.

"I strongly urge the expansion of Medicaid eligibility in North Carolina as allowed under the Affordable Care Act. This expansion will give tens of thousands of North Carolinians access to health care that they presently lack and/or cannot afford. Not only is giving these people the morally and ethically righteous thing to do, it will create a healthier work force, reduce the strains on our state's emergency rooms, help keep rural hospitals afloat, and create jobs. The old adage that ""an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure"" is relevant here because expanding Medicaid coverage will increase access to preventive care, the benefits of which include reducing serious illness and the long hospital stays and/or medical bankruptcies that are more likely to occur when large numbers of North Carolinians cannot get the preventive care they need. The expansion of Medicaid will also help reduce infant mortality. North Carolina has one of the U.S.'s worst infant mortality rates. If you believe, as many North Carolinians do in ""right to life,"" shouldn't Medicaid be expanded in North Carolina as a way to help prevent North Carolina babies from dying at a higher rate than babies in many other states?",211085,18 Jul 2016 18:51:29

While I understand that the waiver is intended to connect children and families in our state to better health options, I am deeply concerned that large and unacceptable numbers of those families will continue to be without access to health care under the currently proposed plan. I urge the NC legislature to expand Medicaid eligibility, as permitted by the Affordable Care Act, and provide essential health care access to those, some 300,000 individuals, who do not have other reliable options. These are individuals who are caught in gaps of eligibility for Medicaid and financial assistance in the health insurance marketplace. Reliance on charity, free/low-cost clinics and the emergency room for health care is simply not working. We all pay eventually when large numbers of our citizens do not have regular, reliable health care.

Re: Family Health
There is mounting evidence that childhood Medicaid eligibility ""significantly improves health, educational, and financial outcomes in adolescence and adulthood: (North Carolina Child Health Report Card, 2016; NC-Medicaid -Parent-Paper). One of the clearest findings is that parents's access to health care has direct and significant impact on the health of their children, in that insuring parents provides economic security, and when parents are insured, their children are more likely to be insured as well. When treatment for mental and physical health problems is accessible, people can get the preventative care that can so often avoid more serious and expensive conditions, hospital stays, workplace absences and even more extreme family disruptions .

North Carolina deserves the health and economic benefits that have been shown to accrue to ""expansion states"", as compared to non-expansion states. Expanded Medicaid is critical for the thousands of our citizens who are currently without reliable access to health care.

Thank you for consideration of these crucially important matters.

"I am a pediatrician in North Carolina. With CCNC we currently have a cost effective program with an 8% reduction in PMPM over the past 5 years!

"As a private general pediatrician I am very disappointed in the recommendations for the NC Medicaid waiver. The current Community Care of NC system is very effective at coordinating care for my patients, is cost-effective, and is in fact considered a model system that has been emulated.

"I am a Pediatrician in NC and formerly served as the Medical Director of the NC Managed Care program 16 years ago.I am opposed to the present waiver because it does nothing to improved quality and it is a smokescreen for it's real purpose which is purely a misguided effort to torpedo a very successful, cost effective award winning managed care program which has the support of the entire medical community called CCNC. The proposed waiver is an ""Alice in Wonderland"" document. It was put together by a team that was directed by the Legislature to create a document to convince CMS that it is an effort to improve quality. This document is full off inaccuracies and hypotheticals which are unachievable without the support of the medical community. This support is nonexistent. It talks about vague entities which would take years to develop whose functions are nebulous. It describes a MH system as being a model but which is presently abhorred by the medical community. The genesis of this waiver is based on inaccurate financial data , subsequently found to be inaccurate, coupled with personal vendettas by some members of the Legislature who were determined to get rid of an award winning, cost effective ,provider supported program called CCNC. I strongly suggest that it not be approved. Thank you for you careful review f the waiver proposal.",211105,18 Jul 2016 20:12:41

"With the current Medicaid wavier the manage care organization in my area clinical review team has been violating individuals civil and ADA rights with no oversight of the state of NC or CMS. They have placed a number of families and individuals in harms way and cause some parents to be jailed. I find it offensive the MCO, DMA , and DHHS made a surplus of $ 136 million in State Medicaid while individuals lost needed services or never got them to begin with. I know from personal experience that the clinical review denied my son services due to him not being able to ""read or write"" which qualified him for the services to being with in NC. In the appeal process it was passed off as a ""glitch"" that ended up costing my name to be slandered in court, son's civil rights violated, and great cost in money and time while the system bullied and strong armed my family. At least we did not have to go to jail as another family in my area did while fighting for their child's services. My current view of the MCO system is that it violates, abuse, neglects, and exploit the families they serve and pockets the money for their own personal gain while individuals with IDD are placed in harms way. The gap in services will continue with small projects to give the general appearance of meeting the gap need for services. In the individual's service needs the clinical review team will continue to violate individuals in NC for profit with no regards state or federal laws of protection of one's civil rights. They will use their legal teams to continue to abuse them into having no voice in the process.",211113,18 Jul 2016 20:19:35
"I am a family doctor who has been practicing in NC for 11 years, caring for both insured, underinsured and uninsured patients. The NC Medicaid Reform Demonstration waiver request is flawed for the following reasons:

1. Capitated care will only reduce costs by limiting care

2. Corporate, for-profit management increases administrative costs

3. Competitive networks produce overlapping wasteful bureaucracies

4. Dismantles the Community Care of North Carolina's well-developed non-profit, award-winning, provider-led regional networks which had some of the lowest administrative costs and the lowest annual increase in costs in the US -- don't change what works!!

5. Lack of provision for North Carolinians who do not qualify for insurance (those left ""in the gap"", unable to afford insurance offerings through the Affordable Care Act's Marketplaces, often too poor even to qualify for any Federal subsidies for these products). Specifically, this program does not provide expansion of Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act.

For these reasons, I request that you do not allow this demonstration in its current form.

"NC needs to close the medical coverage gap that now exists for approximately half a million people, many of whom are working and still cannot afford basic health insurance. My friend of over 30 years has a 31 year old daughter who has been diagnosed with Stage IV ovarian cancer. This young women has worked for most of her short adult life, but the ravages of this disease has left her unable to work, and COBRA has expired. She has just enough in savings to not qualify for ACA, and does not qualify for Medicaid. What will happen to someone in circumstances such as this? If NC had expanded Medicaid she would be able to have coverage. This is not just an issue of basic health care being a right, but makes economic sense for our state and for our hospitals, which are providing costly emergency care that most likely must be written off as a loss. NC cannot afford to not expand this service for humanitarian and economic reasons.",211121,18 Jul 2016 20:30:37
"As a physician in training who hopes to serve the communities of rural Western NC, I know that both I and my patients need Medicaid expansion in order to thrive. Rural practices are closing in droves because without Medicaid, many patients are unable to pay their doctors. This is a bad deal for entire communities, as the only providers in town can't keep their doors open.
Everyone deserves access to health care, and the gap that exists right now between ACA coverage and Medicad leaves too many people without options. The uninsured end up in hospital emergency rooms, and hospitals end up requesting increased tax payer support because of all of the uninsured patients they care for. So in the end, it is much less expensive and more humane to make sure everyone has insurance to start with, and can get the preventive care they need to stay healthy. In the end it will save money and more importantly, allow all the citizens of this great state to be healthy, productive members of their communities.",211125,18 Jul 2016 21:19:31
"Please read these comments seriously- these are exactly like the comments at the statewide DMA listening sessions; universally against this foolhardy change. There is ZERO support from clinicians for this change. I realize that CMS didn't get exact transcripts of the comments- but this is what they were like: Passionate for the care of children and infuriated by the callous disregard of child health experts by our state of NC General Assembly. We know a lot more about this than they do- and they ignored us.

Our legislators might believe that the MCO companies will bear cost overruns year after year without increasing cost to the state, but if they believe that they must also believe in the Easter Bunny. Our PMPM continues to decrease in the current system- it makes NO sense to abandon this winning team.

The experience in Iowa has been a disaster with their transition to mismanaged care medicaid.

"Please reform Medicaid and expand the coverage gap. As a person who was temporarily making an annual income that just slightly exceeded the $11,000+ limit for coverage, I just needed a few months of health coverage to help me afford a few basic medications. I had just graduated and was working hard to find a job, but could only find temporary positions for a while. In Maryland, where I had come from, my health coverage was entirely taken care of while I was a student making almost no income and living on savings. But when I moved to North Carolina and was still searching for a job, I was told that my cheapest coverage option would be upwards of $300 -- and that was just for catastrophic insurance. How does it make sense that a person making little to no income should be asked to pay $300 per month for health insurance? Please expand the coverage gap, and provide fair and adequate coverage to the many thousands of North Carolinians who are struggling to get by and just need some help for a short time as they get back on their feet.",211133,18 Jul 2016 21:29:48

"Thank you for allowing me to comment on the proposed Medicaid Reform. My chief regret is that Medicaid expansion is not included, but I'm also concerned that the reforms will lead to smaller numbers of provider participation.

I am a practicing hospitalist in Stanly County, and see patients who likely would not require hospitalization were Medicaid expanded. I see others at a free clinic who wouldn't need to be there if NC were to expand Medicaid.

At the free clinic, I recently took care of a nurse that I previously worked alongside for several years in the emergency room. It stunned me to see that someone who spent years tending to others' health doesn't have access to real health care herself. She has suffered cardiac conditions that we are able to help with, but she would benefit from services we can't offer her. If Medicaid were expanded, this great nurse would have real health care.

I also see patients regularly in the hospital who would benefit from Medicaid expansion. For example, I see diabetics who present over and over in a critical state because they cannot afford their insulin. Not only would Medicaid help them live longer and better, it would decrease uncompensated hospital fees.

Finally, I would add my concern that the proposed reform may lead to physicians dropping out of the Medicaid provider network. In my community, I already see patients in the hospital who lack a PCP, because the only ones accepting new patients are those at an urgent care. I'm concerned that the transition toward managed care organizations would lead the ones already participating to drop out of Medicaid altogether, which would be tragic.

I'm greatly concerned that Medicaid reform proposals will hurt North Carolinians by providers dropping out of the program, and wish that we could offer them the Medicaid expansion they need.",211145,18 Jul 2016 21:49:55

"Have we learned nothing from recent history? The dismantling of our community based mental health care system to a managed care system in 2000 was disastrous for mentally ill patients and the system still has not recovered. We have people waiting days or weeks in ER rooms waiting for treatment. We are exporting our mentally ill children out of state to as far away as Florida to receive inpatient care. In these facilities there have been cases of sexual abuse and the state has no oversight authority.

Managed care means managing to make a profit. For profit medicine does not have patient care and good patient outcomes as its main objective. Our current Medicaid system has been touted a model for other states. The problems of the current system have been created by the legislature underfunding the program. It does not need to be privatized and divvied up between the 158 health care entities that have lobbyist who constantly stream thru the legislative building.
The poor and sick that need Medicaid can't afford a lobbyist to look after their best interest.

What is going to be done when a person under this proposed managed care?
Are they going to be denied or delayed in getting adequate testing to obtain a diagnosis? What going to be done to ensure delay or denial of care does not result in the progression of a disease to an unmanageable or fatal stage? What about a person who has cancer or a serious car accident that requires life long treatment and care, when the person's expenses exceed the allotted amount for that person, are they just going to deny treatment? What is going to prohibit rationed care. What is going to be done to insure that these companies are going to see that patients get the care they need?

It also does not plan out how to maintain access for children to providers and specialists or how specialist networks will structured to maintain continuity of care.

"As a Pediatric Practice Adninistrator for. a large group of private pediatricians with a practice panel of approximately 40% Medicaid and a tax paying citizen of NC, I do not support the waiver and respectfully ask CMS to please deny the waiver. The waiver is not good for children. The waiver is a waste of my tax dollars to reform a system that is already known as a national model for how to care for children the right way. Much of the hard work already done by the CCNC group is being torn apart in favor of for-profit insurance companies setting up their own MCOs. The waiver allows for up to 15 of these MCOs to design their own systems and seek participating providers and manage their care to contain costs. Please listen when I tell you pediatricians will NOT participate with multiple MCOs to compete for Medicaid patient enrollment. Much needed specialists will NOT participate in multiple MCOs. Why? The increased cost of managing patient care through a myriad of networks and rules will exceed the reimbursement. Reimbursement is 1/2 that of a private paying patient (especially since the Medicaid/Medicare parity from the ACA was unfortunately not sustained). Medicaid works in NC only because it is a well established and efficient system that most providers trust enough in which to still participate. Participating in multiple MCOs that are for profit and building their plans FOR PROFIT will not be efficient nor trusted and the ones that will be negatively impacted will be children of the poorest citizens in NC.

If you need more examples of why to deny, refer to how privatizing the NC mental health system in the past several years has ruined mental health services fo NC citizens, especially children, because I can tell you that many of the good therapists just choose not to participate with Medicaid now and those that do never know if they are getting paid from their local entity. Children in NC deserve better and this waiver is NOT better. I would also like to apologize for our legislators sending this waiver to CMS. The political processed failed. The overwhelming feedback from their sessions with citizens across the State was against the waiver. I can only assume the for profit MCOs were so generous with their campaign dollars that it has clouded their understanding of the issues and responsibility to listen to their constituents.

"NC also desperately needs to expand Medicaid coverage to hundreds of thousands! Just by providing insurance for pregnant mothers alone, the state will save on the cost of future care for children by helping to prevent many illnesses & disabilities.

CMS oversight of & involvement w/ NC regarding its NC Reform proposal, etc. There are many troubling aspects in this waiver that NC has done little to address. Physicians & others in healthcare as well as individual citizens have voiced extreme concern with this waiver's dividing the state into regions of care that limit patient access to providers and utilize numerous LMOs, etc. that will create a billing nightmare for providers & patients alike. NC's Medicaid program is not broken. Why are they trying to ""fix"" it until it is? Most providers participate in NC Medicaid now, but under this new waiver, they likely will not. In addition, waivers & services for medically fragile children and people with disabilities (these waivers are included in the Medicaid Reform waiver) in the state are being butchered with little CMS accountability. NC failed to involve stakeholders & families in dialogue concerning major changes to the CAP waiver program that will significantly hurt these populations & their families. This is a CMS requirement, and NC flat out lied about it when submitting it to CMS. After being challenged by families, the state now plans to hold community meetings beginning next week, a work group, etc., but it does not change the fact that NC broke the law by not following CMS rules. Who knows how many other CMS rules NC has broken! CMS desperately needs to crack down on NC's DHHS (especially DMA) and hold them accountable for their responsibility to the citizens of NC.

"Require North Carolina to expand Medicaid and preserve Community Care of NC as conditions of Medicaid Reform. More than one-third of the 10 million North Carolinians live in low income, small rural towns or unincorporated areas where Medicaid is the largest insurer. Without Medicaid expansion to keep local hospitals open and providers engaged, NC DHHS will not be able to meet the goals of Medicaid reform. NC Medicaid eligible patients living in rural, low income areas will not have ""A Better Experience of Care"" because they will lack comprehensive services and an adequate number of providers. The communities where these same Medicaid eligible patients live will not have ""Better Health in Our Community."" Expanding Medicaid will provide the financial support necessary to keep open the safety net hospitals, federally qualified health centers (FQHCs) and free clinics that dot rural North Carolina.

Our home grown Community Care of North Carolina has kept 90% of our primary care providers engaged with the Medicaid population and with each other as they collaborate on improvements. That has kept our Medicaid population more healthy and it saved the State millions of dollars. Expanding Medicaid would maintain the physicians who live in these declining communities, support expansion and communication upgrades at our FQHCs and support communication and collaboration among the physicians. It would also increase the number of health care workers in low income areas and provide an economic boost to declining towns.

Expanding Medicaid also supports cost containment and funding predictability. Medicaid expansion states have reduced costs for uncompensated care and improving heath with reduced cost among the newly insured. There is no downside to expanding Medicaid. There is no reason to dismantle or essentially change our successful Community Care of North Carolina.",211669,19 Jul 2016 08:30:40

"CMS: Please do not contribute to the destruction of Pediatric Healthcare in North Carolina by approval of the NC 1115 Waiver. The fact that you have been given the task - by law - of ""Approval"" means that you can deny this! I realize that it is rare for CMS to ever deny a state's request, but it is rarer for a state to EVER ask for permission to destroy the best Medicaid system in the country ""just because they can"".
I am a pediatrician and went to one of the public comment sessions required prior waiver submission. No one spoke in favor of the waiver!. Afterwards I found the highest ranking state official - Deputy Secretary for Health Services, Randall Williams, MD and was speechless when he told me he thought pediatricians would be In Favor of the reform since it would make things ""better"". He practiced OB.GYN in Raleigh and as a physician did not accept Medicaid patients. He was personally clueless about our great program. The people who support and designed the waiver to fir the legislation have NO IDEA what they are doing!
They may mean well, but they did not bother to modify the waiver after 99% of all public COMMENTS were NEGATIVE. This is not about improving Medicaid - I t is about satisfying a handful of legislators! The Legislature did not ask for nor listen to those professionals providing care to the state's Medicaid population when they passed a law intended to pay back political favors and to destroy CCNC.
This waiver requests has nice sounding words that are meaningless. Do not be fooled. The sole purpose of this waiver is to destroy 30 years of incremental improvement in NC's Medicaid program. The legislation was proposed during a recession and during a period when NC DMA replaced the old computer system with a new one - there was no data to refute outrageous claims against the current program. We now have the data but the legislators driving this train were not interested in truth.
Please do your duty and deny this application or scale it back to ONLY ADULTS. SAVE NC PEDIATRIC MEDICAID! Keep our DMA office in charge of running our Medicaid program - they are doing a wonderful job and should not be replaced with For Profit companies like UHC! Please help us!

"North Carolina's Medicaid reform plan lacks the most important change needed to improve health care for North Carolinians and strengthen the provider community — Medicaid expansion! Medicaid coverage should be extended to all adults ages 18-64 with incomes at or below 138% of the Federal Poverty Level (FPL). In North Carolina, expanded Medicaid would cover more than 400,000 people; at least 244,000 of those in the Coverage Gap are uninsured as a result.

In 2014, 43% of all community health center patients in North Carolina were uninsured and more than 70% of patients lived at or below 100% FPL. Community health center staff see firsthand the significant health challenges and barriers to needed services that these uninsured and low-income patients face. In North Carolina, nearly 40,000 women are not receiving recommended preventive screenings, 27,044 diabetics cannot get much needed medications, and 45,500 individuals with depression are not getting the treatment they need. In fact, providers often have to modify treatment plans for uninsured patients because of their inability to afford a specialist visit or pay for needed medications.

With Medicaid expansion, community health centers in North Carolina could better coordinate the full spectrum of care their patients need. Medicaid expansion would also bring new income to the community health centers that would enable them to expand sites and services, hire new staff, and integrate and improve the care they provide.

Don't let North Carolina's Medicaid program leaving out the most important change for our state's health. We need North Carolina to expand Medicaid!",211797,19 Jul 2016 08:37:47

"I have been a pediatrician in North Carolina for 22 years and actively daily provide excellent primary care to North Carolina's children regardless of whether or not they have Medicaid, private insurance, or are self pay. I am VERY concerned about the proposal to change the coverage and funding from what we currently have. I have witnessed CCNC from its development until now and am impressed at the personal, community based, physician led and driven advances in care we have already been able to make. I have NOT been impressed by anything that increases the complexity of care, the number of steps required to provide even simple prescriptions at times, the change to require approval of outpatient xray procedures some of which we have to actually argue with an approval person to get a procedure or xray done for our children. I am DISMAYED to think that we would have multiple agencies to contend with and that the patients themselves would be more responsible for navigating these different choices. They already have trouble with the current degree of flexibility.

"North Carolina's Medicaid reform plan lacks the most important change needed to improve health care for North Carolinians and strengthen the provider community — Medicaid expansion! Medicaid coverage should be extended to all adults ages 18-64 with incomes at or below 138% of the Federal Poverty Level (FPL). In North Carolina, expanded Medicaid would cover more than 400,000 people; at least 244,000 of those in the Coverage Gap are uninsured as a result.

In 2014, 43% of all community health center patients in North Carolina were uninsured and more than 70% of patients lived at or below 100% FPL. Community health center staff see firsthand the significant health challenges and barriers to needed services that these uninsured and low-income patients face. In North Carolina, nearly 40,000 women are not receiving recommended preventive screenings, 27,044 diabetics cannot get much needed medications, and 45,500 individuals with depression are not getting the treatment they need. In fact, providers often have to modify treatment plans for uninsured patients because of their inability to afford a specialist visit or pay for needed medications.

With Medicaid expansion, community health centers in North Carolina could better coordinate the full spectrum of care their patients need. Medicaid expansion would also bring new income to the community health centers that would enable them to expand sites and services, hire new staff, and integrate and improve the care they provide.

Don't let North Carolina's Medicaid program leaving out the most important change for our state's health. We need North Carolina to expand Medicaid!",211989,19 Jul 2016 08:47:29

"I work at a pediatric office in NC as Medical Lab Tech, and i do not support this change. Please deny this waiver and save our Medicaid Program.
I have worked in the Medical field for 28 years and I think this Medicaid Reform is absolutely wrong. We have people who cant afford any type of healthcare. Medicaid is the only health insurance that is available to them.
I currently work for a pediatric provider in Southeastern NC. Working in coordination with Community Care of NC, we have reduced ER visits, improved care coordination, and reduce costs by managing referrals to to more expensive specialists. Completely overhauling a successful system seems ridiculous. Therefore, I oppose the proposed Medicaid Waiver for NC.
I am a Medical lab Technician working in Robeson County, one of the poorest counties in NC. I cannot support the waiver because I feel it will greatly affect the access to care for the patient. We are dealing with some of the most vulnerable patients that have parents that do not understand how to navigate the healthcare system, and the waiver will just complicate the entire system.
I work in a pediatrics every day. In fact, in my office 3 out of every 4 of our receive Medicaid. A change to the Medicaid program directly correlates to a reduction in adequate care for our patients. In continuation, it directly affects my job. I do not see how North Carolina can propose this reform to Medicaid and expect it to help those it directly affects. Not only will it create such a burden on the practice at the administrative level, it will also cause a greater burden on the families receiving Medicaid benefits. A change to the Medicaid program is a negative change for North Carolina.
The State of North Carolina's request, know as a Section 1115 Demonstration waiver, would replace the award-winning Community care of North Carolina (CCNC) program with a complex and unproven model that could disrupt established provider networks, diminish access to care, and degrade health outcomes for North Carolina Medicaid population.",211997,19 Jul 2016 08:47:33

A change to the Medicaid program is a negative change for NC.,212057,19 Jul 2016 08:50:18
As a registration intake in the pediatric medical field I feel it imperative to voice my concerns for the Medicaid reform. I see first hand how children insured by Medicaid struggle to get the healthcare they need. the suggested reform including the waiver will make this process even harder. it is not fair to punish the children of nc by increasing the number of hurdles they must cross in order to receive the care that they need. please consider removing the waiver to help nc children.,212061,19 Jul 2016 08:50:25

"I currently work for a pediatric provider in Southeastern NC. Working in coordination with Community Care of NC, we have reduced ER visits, improved care coordination, and reduce costs by managing referrals to more expensive specialists. Our current collaboration with CCNC is very efficient for physicians, staff and patients. Completely overhauling a successful system seems ridiculous. Therefore, I oppose the proposed Medicaid Waiver for NC.",212073,19 Jul 2016 08:50:49
"I am 29 years old. I am in nursing school and cannot afford to quit my job due to obligations. This means I cannot afford the extra expense of health insurance. This puts ME at risk all because I am trying to better myself and my life. Medicaid would be very beneficial for me right now until I am done with school, and without it, I am left with nothing.

North Carolina's Medicaid reform plan lacks the most important change needed to improve health care for North Carolinians and strengthen the provider community — Medicaid expansion! Medicaid coverage should be extended to all adults ages 18-64 with incomes at or below 138% of the Federal Poverty Level (FPL). In North Carolina, expanded Medicaid would cover more than 400,000 people; at least 244,000 of those in the Coverage Gap are uninsured as a result.
In 2014, 43% of all community health center patients in North Carolina were uninsured and more than 70% of patients lived at or below 100% FPL. Community health center staff see firsthand the significant health challenges and barriers to needed services that these uninsured and low-income patients face. In North Carolina, nearly 40,000 women are not receiving recommended preventive screenings, 27,044 diabetics cannot get much needed medications, and 45,500 individuals with depression are not getting the treatment they need. In fact, providers often have to modify treatment plans for uninsured patients because of their inability to afford a specialist visit or pay for needed medications.
With Medicaid expansion, community health centers in North Carolina could better coordinate the full spectrum of care their patients need. Medicaid expansion would also bring new income to the community health centers that would enable them to expand sites and services, hire new staff, and integrate and improve the care they provide.
Don't let North Carolina's Medicaid program leaving out the most important change for our state's health. We need North Carolina to expand Medicaid!",212077,19 Jul 2016 08:50:50

Medicaid reform will not work if it does not directly help those who utilize the services. The CCNC program has done a great job at helping the citizens of North Carolina and the Medicaid reform would un-do the positive advances that this program has made. It is our job, as a state, to make provisions for the health of our children and these proposed changes add nothing but more barriers in ability to access the level of healthcare that our children need.

"Perfectly stated!!! ""CMS: Please do not contribute to the destruction of Pediatric Healthcare in North Carolina by approval of the NC 1115 Waiver. The fact that you have been given the task - by law - of ""Approval"" means that you can deny this! I realize that it is rare for CMS to ever deny a state's request, but it is rare for a state to EVER ask for permission to destroy the best Medicaid system in the country ""just because they can"".
I am a pediatrician and went to one of the public comment sessions required prior waiver submission. No one spoke in favor of the waiver!. Afterwards I found the highest ranking state official - Deputy Secretary for Health Services, Randall Williams, MD and was speechless when he told me he thought pediatricians would be In Favor of the reform since it would make things ""better"". He practiced OB.GYN in Raleigh and as a physician did not accept Medicaid patients. He was personally clueless about our great program. The people who support and designed the waiver to fir the legislation have NO IDEA what they are doing!
They may mean well, but they did not bother to modify the waiver after 99% of all public COMMENTS were NEGATIVE. This is not about improving Medicaid - I t is about satisfying a handful of legislators! The Legislature did not ask for nor listen to those professionals providing care to the state's Medicaid population when they passed a law intended to pay back political favors and to destroy CCNC.
This waiver requests has nice sounding words that are meaningless. Do not be fooled. The sole purpose of this waiver is to destroy 30 years of incremental improvement in NC's Medicaid program. The legislation was proposed during a recession and during a period when NC DMA replaced the old computer system with a new one - there was no data to refute outrageous claims against the current program. We now have the data but the legislators driving this train were not interested in truth.
Please do your duty and deny this application or scale it back to ONLY ADULTS. SAVE NC PEDIATRIC MEDICAID! Keep our DMA office in charge of running our Medicaid program - they are doing a wonderful job and should not be replaced with For Profit companies like UHC!

"Please deny this outrageous 1115 waiver request by NC!
The state legislature told our public that this ""reform"" was needed to control the budget over-runs of the state's Medicaid program. This is not true. The state went through a recession and purposefully ""low-balled"" the budget for Medicaid as a way to free up monies for other needed programs. Then they were ""shocked"" that the Medicaid program went over budget! Not a Medicaid spending problem, this was a BUDGETARY problem! There was also a recession and more people were signed up for Medicaid which is NOT a Medicaid spending problem - it was an economy problem! When the Governor took office, the top level management of Medicaid all got ""pink slips"" - with no job performance review. They were told that they could re-apply for their job. No surprise no one did! Nor is it a surprise when NC Medicaid went through some difficult times without leaders. And they changed computer systems. Either one of those issues is bad, but with both - it is amazing the employees left at DMA were able to hold this together! Our Per Member Per Month costs is 8% less than 5 years ago - CCNC is working and working well.

Exercise Judgment - DENY THIS WAIVER! Send it back to the legislature, and let they re-work something next year with a new group of legislators who value healthy children.

"North Carolina's Medicaid reform plan lacks the most important change needed to improve health care for North Carolinians and strengthen the provider community — Medicaid expansion! Medicaid coverage should be extended to all adults ages 18-64 with incomes at or below 138% of the Federal Poverty Level (FPL). In North Carolina, expanded Medicaid would cover more than 400,000 people; at least 244,000 of those in the Coverage Gap are uninsured as a result.
In 2014, 43% of all community health center patients in North Carolina were uninsured and more than 70% of patients lived at or below 100% FPL. Community health center staff see firsthand the significant health challenges and barriers to needed services that these uninsured and low-income patients face. In North Carolina, nearly 40,000 women are not receiving recommended preventive screenings, 27,044 diabetics cannot get much needed medications, and 45,500 individuals with depression are not getting the treatment they need. In fact, providers often have to modify treatment plans for uninsured patients because of their inability to afford a specialist visit or pay for needed medications.
With Medicaid expansion, community health centers in North Carolina could better coordinate the full spectrum of care their patients need. Medicaid expansion would also bring new income to the community health centers that would enable them to expand sites and services, hire new staff, and integrate and improve the care they provide.

"I work in a Federally Qualified Health Center in North Carolina. Every day I work, I see the adverse health consequences of our state's refusal of enhanced Medicaid funding. My patients cannot afford medications or doctor visits, use the ER's for minor problems, and do not come for regular appointments. Despite ample medical and economic evidence that refusing Medicaid funds was a terrible mistake, our governing bodies have taken no remedial action. Our local hospitals are staggering under the weight of unreimbursed expenses, and the poor and the sick bear the overwhelming burden of this political mistake.
As to Medicaid reform, I feel that privatizing this vital service will have similar consequences to those of prison privatization--that corporate profits will outweigh actual care for those of our citizens who need it most. I find a continuing decrement in medical professional morale as professionals work harder with more meaningless measures of ""excellence"" with less and less time to spend with patients.

"I am the parent of a profoundly disabled 11 year old. Like many of her friends, she depends on the Medicaid waiver services. We depend on the staff coming into our home to help provide daily care for her. She is total care for all of her daily living needs.

Likewise, the additional funding available to us allow us to get equipment that insurance would otherwise not pay for that is essential for her safety and care, such as adaptive showering/toileting equipment, diapers or formula supplies. I am able to use waiver funding to get her an adaptive car seat to safely transport her around the community. Although my daughter is somewhat mobile, many friends require special vehicle adaptations such as a lift. Those modifications cost a lot of money, and are simply not something most families can afford and they depend on the waiver to assist them to made the changes.

I've also read that there are plans to cut NCHIPP. This subsidy pays us to keep primary insurance, so that medicaid is a secondary payer. Without this plan, we would likely eliminate private insurance for our daughter and the burden would go entirely to Medicaid, which would cost the state much more than simply paying for insurance premiums.

It is possible that with the proposed changes, some of our offices may end up in different regions. In a very poor, rural area, helping children with Medicaid receive the care they need is already increasingly difficult.

"As a Registered Nurse in children's health in North Carolina, I see how a reform to Medicaid will be an administrative nightmare. I work in an office in which 76% of our patients receive assistance from Medicaid. In addition, the company for which I am employed operates in 4 different offices in different counties. It is possible that with the proposed changes, some of our offices may end up in different regions. In a very poor, rural area, helping children with Medicaid receive the care they need is already increasingly difficult. With the addition of these proposed changes, it will be even harder for these children to receive the care their need.

I would like to strongly encourage you to vote to expand Medicaid to include those with the lowest incomes in our state. I have worked at community health centers for over 20 years as a family physician and see the need for this expansion on a daily basis. We can take care of primary care issues but the patients then have a very limited ability to access imaging studies and specialty care when needed and many medications are out of reach for them. Please vote to expand Medicaid to help our most vulnerable patients to receive the care they need.

Without Medicaid my children would not receive the care or medicine that they need on a daily basis because as a full-time employee I would not be able to afford it. Not only does Medicaid help cover office/hospital expenses it also covers my children's prescriptions that they take on a daily basis. Both my children are asthmatic so they require follow-up appointments and medication refills that Medicaid helps cover. My oldest son has been diagnosed with 'Migraines' so he see's a specialist which again, Medicaid covers. So, not only is Medicaid very much needed for other children and families but also for mine, a hard full-time working Mother who just wants to be able to provide and care for her children.

"As a registered voter, and resident of North Carolina, I am asking our federal government to forcefully request, if not legislate, that the state of North Carolina extend Medicaid coverage to the uninsured.

North Carolina, statistics reveal about 244,000 adults are stuck in the 'coverage gap,' with no good way to get health insurance.
Most of these people are working in industries such as retail, construction, or food service, but their incomes are too high to qualify for Medicaid and too low to afford health insurance in the private marketplace.

Is the Federal Government aware that a working adult without children who makes less than $11,880 a year can't get low-cost health insurance or NC Medicaid?

I'm aware the federal government is currently considering whether or not to approve changes to NC's Medicaid program. Unfortunately, our state officials haven't proposed closing the coverage gap by extending Medicaid to low-income adults. How can North Carolina state and federal lawmakers sleep at night knowing that our government continues to leave these individuals out?

244,000 mothers, fathers, children, aunts, uncles, and other family members are without appropriate access to health care. You have the power to affect the quality of life of 244,000 North Carolina residents, human beings, and people who pay taxes! We voted you into office and we can vote you out!

"North Carolina's Medicaid reform plan lacks the most important change needed to improve health care for North Carolinians and strengthen the provider community — Medicaid expansion! Medicaid coverage should be extended to all adults ages 18-64 with incomes at or below 138% of the Federal Poverty Level (FPL). In North Carolina, expanded Medicaid would cover more than 400,000 people; at least 244,000 of those in the Coverage Gap are uninsured as a result.

In 2014, 43% of all community health center patients in North Carolina were uninsured and more than 70% of patients lived at or below 100% FPL. Community health center staff see firsthand the significant health challenges and barriers to needed services that these uninsured and low-income patients face. In North Carolina, nearly 40,000 women are not receiving recommended preventive screenings, 27,044 diabetics cannot get much needed medications, and 45,500 individuals with depression are not getting the treatment they need. In fact, providers often have to modify treatment plans for uninsured patients because of their inability to afford a specialist visit or pay for needed medications.

With Medicaid expansion, community health centers in North Carolina could better coordinate the full spectrum of care their patients need.

"The North Carolina 1115 Demonstration Waiver falls short in a significant way: it fails to expand Medicaid coverage to an estimated 500,000 hardworking, North Carolinians. From a public health perspective the implications of this decision are enormous. Study after study demonstrates that the uninsured experience sicker lives and poor health than others. Medicaid enrollees have access to far greater health care services than their uninsured counterparts.

North Carolina's Medicaid program currently does not cover parents whose incomes are greater than 50 percent of the federal poverty level (about $10,000 for a family of three) and adults without children who are not elderly or disabled have no coverage at all. The state's Medicaid eligibility levels rank in the bottom quartile of the states. According to the National Center for Health Statistics, North Carolina's uninsured rate is 15.6 percent, exceeding the national average of 10.5 percent.

"As a registered voter, and resident of North Carolina, I am asking our federal government to forcefully request, if not legislate, that the state of North Carolina extend Medicaid coverage to the uninsured.

North Carolina, statistics reveal about 244,000 adults are stuck in the 'coverage gap,' with no good way to get health insurance.
Most of these people are working in industries such as retail, construction, or food service, but their incomes are too high to qualify for Medicaid and too low to afford health insurance in the private marketplace.

Is the Federal Government aware that a working adult without children who makes less than $11,880 a year can't get low-cost health insurance or NC Medicaid?

I'm aware the federal government is currently considering whether or not to approve changes to NC's Medicaid program. Unfortunately, our state officials haven't proposed closing the coverage gap by extending Medicaid to low-income adults. How can North Carolina state and federal lawmakers sleep at night knowing that our government continues to leave these individuals out?

244,000 mothers, fathers, children, aunts, uncles, and other family members are without appropriate access to health care. You have the power to affect the quality of life of 244,000 North Carolina residents, human beings, and people who pay taxes! We voted you into office and we can vote you out!

"The NC plan to reform Medicaid should include closing the coverage gap. Health care access and equity should be the cornerstones of any reform plan. Most in the gap (over 60%) are working, but at jobs without benefits (like construction, child care, retail, fast food, contract/freelance or self-employed work) or they work several part-time jobs and can't qualify for benefits or they are working parttime and studying parttime (for a better job or a degree) and don't have health insurance. Others stay at home and take care of sick or disabled relatives. Health equity is critical. Medical care should not be a privilege just for those who can afford it; it should be a basic right. Not only does it make sense from a humanitarian point of view, but economically, as well.

Specifically for children needing advanced care, the Medicaid Waiver process would make that virtually impossible. Because of the nightmare Medicaid would become, I refuse to support the proposed reform.",214445,19 Jul 2016 10:07:10
I do not support the Medicaid reform. I work in a pediatric office and we treat many children with health problems that have to be referred out. This waiver would prevent us from being able to get the children where they need to be to receive the appropriate care and in turn possibly cause the parent to have to take the child elsewhere for treatment.,214449,19 Jul 2016 10:07:14
"Thank you for the opportunity to comment on North Carolina's Medicaid Reform 1115 Demonstration. North Carolina has proposed a major change to the delivery of Medicaid in our state. One of the goals of the waiver is to connect children and families to better health. We urge North Carolina's leaders to expand Medicaid eligibility as permitted by the Affordable Care Act, thus providing essential health care access to more than 300,000 individuals in our state who currently have no other options available to them. They do not fall into an eligible category for Medicaid and they earn too little to qualify for financial assistance in the Health Insurance. I strongly oppose this waiver.",214453,19 Jul 2016 10:07:14

"I work in pediatrics every day. In fact, in my office, 3 out of every 4 of our patients receive Medicaid. A change to the Medicaid program directly correlates to a reduction in adequate care for our patients. In continuation, it directly affects my job. I do not see how North Carolina can propose this reform to Medicaid and expect it to help those it directly affects. Not only will it create such a burden on the practice at the administrative level, it will also cause a greater burden on the families receiving Medicaid benefits. A change to the Medicaid program is a negative change for North Carolina.",214461,19 Jul 2016 10:08:13
"I own a small DME providing mainly incontinence and enteral supplies and equipment. My customers can choose whatever brand of diaper that works best for them, even if I end up making very little profit. It's important to me that my customers are satisfied, that they enjoy good skin integrity and dry clothes during the night.

My concern with Medicaid managed care is that the ACOs will do what other states with Medicaid managed care have done: give all the business to the single lowest bidder (a national distributor or manufacturer). My customers will get stuck with ""cheap Medicaid diapers,"" the lowest cost feeding pumps and supplies, and all of the local North Carolina-based DME companies will go out of business. Our customers will no longer have a choice.

The reform plan must allow continued competition among DME companies so that patients continue to have a choice of providers throughout the state.",214465,19 Jul 2016 10:09:12

"My step daughter recently had a baby. She works for a daycare in Raleigh that doesn't pay her much. She currently only has one income to help support her child and without Medicaid, she would not have been able to afford a nice hospital like Duke. I believe that without Medicaid it would have been a stressful pregnancy for her not only effecting her mental and physical health, but also the baby. Please expand Medicaid, as it helps a lot of people who are already trying to help themselves, but just can't afford to do so without Medicaid.

Also, North Carolina's Medicaid reform plan lacks the most important change needed to improve health care for North Carolinians and strengthen the provider community — Medicaid expansion! Medicaid coverage should be extended to all adults ages 18-64 with incomes at or below 138% of the Federal Poverty Level (FPL).

Without parents to take care of them ,Who will do it? Someone has to take care of their medical needs. Without medicaid the high risk kids that have heart problems. Who will take care of those kids? Theses are the issues that the waiver will affect.",214745,19 Jul 2016 10:36:14
I currently am employed by a pediatric office in Robeson County and I see that the medicaid reform will greatly impact the children and families if this was to implemented. If you have to work in the pediatric office you see first hand how much the children need for things to be better and not worse. The only ones that suffers is the children. So for the children I cannot support the proposed medicaid waiver.,214749,19 Jul 2016 10:36:38
I work at a pediatric clinic in Robeson county and I feel that they should leave medcaid alone. a lot of our parents don't have jobs that they really can afford to take out the insurance that maybe the company they work for provides.

"Medicaid reform, especially when it includes the changes as proposed by Governor McCrory, will do nothing for the state of North Carolina other than hurt those who are currently in the program. Advancements made with CCNC have made great strides over the years in the Medicaid program and to change it would be devastating to those in the program. I sincerely hope that the politicians involved will take a second look at how these changes will negatively effect those who participate in the program. Sectioning off the state may terminate care by specialists who travel to rural areas. I do not support a reform that does not put the needs of those in the Medicaid program first.",214797,19 Jul 2016 10:42:46
"I worked in GA as an PNP for 10 yrs with statewide managed care. It is difficult as a provider to work with all the different plans. All the plans have different formularies and rules so you had to practice medicine based on what plan the patient has. Some children needed a certain drug but their plan did not cover it, but another one did, so you were constantly having them change plans just so they could get the meds they needed. This takes time so the patient may not have the med they need for a month or more until the plan can be changed. Every time you turn around you had to get a PA for something due to limited coverage. This just takes more time, money and people to get the patient what they need. The patient and provider suffer because providers cannot just see the patient, order a med or test without having another step and "" approval by the company"" to provide what the patient needs. It is so much more efficient to have one Medicaid so all patients have the same coverage for all their needs. There are no extra steps and providers do not have to jump through hoops with all the different plans to get what they need. It delays care for the patient and limits their benefits. Please do not pass this plan. It is just a headache for everyone and does not help patients or providers.
Thanks, PNP in Eastern NC.",214801,19 Jul 2016 10:44:49
"The waiver is not good for the children of NC. Increased MCOs up to 15 allowed in waiver, increased complexity, rules, decreased participation by PCPs and Specialist networks, uncertain reimbursement including possible capitation that will be determined by for-profit entities based on shareholder interests. Loss of CCNC a nationally recognized entity with proven quality and cost containment success. Loss of an efficient Medicaid system, noting that with reimbursements less than ½ of private insurers, the only way pediatricians can continue to see Medicaid patients is with an efficient Medicaid system and the waiver will destroy efficiency causing pediatricians to stop taking Medicaid. This will reduce access to quality care for children, our most vulnerable population. Include any personal stories, if you have them, on how the similar experiment of mental health reform/privatization has not worked in NC, especially with children. Remind them you are a tax payer and this is a waste of tax payer money and the legislature failed to listen to the overwhelming public comment against the waiver before sending it on to CMS- a political process failure for NC.",214805,19 Jul 2016 10:45:46
"North Carolina's Medicaid reform plan lacks the most important change needed to improve health care for North Carolinians and strengthen the provider community — Medicaid expansion! Medicaid coverage should be extended to all adults ages 18-64 with incomes at or below 138% of the Federal Poverty Level (FPL). In NC, expanded Medicaid would cover more than 400,000 people; currently at least 244,000 of those are in the Coverage Gap and are uninsured as a result.
In 2014, 43% of all community health center patients in NC were uninsured and more than 70% of patients lived at or below 100% FPL. Community health center staff see firsthand the significant health challenges and barriers to needed services that these uninsured and low-income patients face. In NC, nearly 40,000 women are not receiving recommended preventive screenings, 27,044 diabetics can't get much needed medications, and 45,500 individuals with depression aren't getting the treatment they need. In fact, providers often have to modify treatment plans for uninsured patients because of their inability to afford a specialist visit or pay for needed medications.
With Medicaid expansion, community health centers in NC could better coordinate the full spectrum of care their patients need. Medicaid expansion would also bring new income to the community health centers enabling them to expand sites and services, hire new staff, and integrate and improve the care they provide.
Expanding North Carolina's Medicaid program would be a most important change for our state's health. We take care of our children through Medicaid benefits, but if their care-givers, parents or other family members don't have access or can't afford access to health insurance, how can those people take care of their children properly? If you don't have your health, what quality of life is that for any of us? We need North Carolina to expand Medicaid! Kathy Hudson, Gaston County, NC",214809,19 Jul 2016 10:50:32
"As an administrator at the largest pediatric corporation in the state, I believe this would detrimentally affect the way our Medicaid patients have access to care. The fact that we have 4 offices that are located in different counties could mean that our patients would not have access to our after hours clinic in one county. This would also mess the system up even more than what it currently is based on its method to reassign patients and dealing with the new 15 different entities for billing.",214813,19 Jul 2016 10:51:23

"I am a Medical Office Assistant in North Carolina and I'm opposed to the waiver. The current system with CCNC has served North Carolina pediatric Medicaid patients very well and the current proposal will destroy the trust and relationships that we have worked hard to build.

The CCNC program has done a great job at helping the families of NC and the Medicaid reform would un-do the positive advances that this program has made. It is our job, as a state, to make provisions for the health of our children and these proposed changes add nothing but more barriers in ability to access the level of healthcar5e that our children need.

"I am providing comment on behalf of the 9,500 uninsured individuals seeking care through our community health center. Since the implementation of the ACA, we have thankfully seen a slight decrease in the number of uninsured adults seeking healthcare services; yet, over 9,500 people came to us last year totally devoid of any type of healthcare coverage. These are people falling into the gap created when the State of North Carolina chose not to participate in the Medicaid expansion. I am expressing my concern from only one eastern North Carolina community health center network; the situation is replicated across the State. Residents of many of our rural counties across the State are living in abject poverty. Adjacent to one of our health center sites is a 'soup kitchen' where I watch crowds of people standing in line every single day for a meal; old people, young people, some with canes and walkers...standing in 95 degree heat for food. Within our own patient population, 75% live at or below 100% of the FPL; that equates to 11,700 people. It seems the very least we can do is open access to healthcare services through Medicaid expansion so that our residents do not have to choose between seeking healthcare services and feeding their family. There are a lot of problems in our State and across the Country these days...problems that don't have solutions. This problem HAS a solution. We need to make it happen.",214941,19 Jul 2016 11:08:32

"I do not see how the proposed legislation will help NC Medicaid children get the care they need. Overhauling a system that has included so many advancements, such as CCNC, is costly and unnecessary. The proposed changes to the Medicaid will make things more difficult for NC children. Living in a poor, rural county with a high percentage of children receiving public insurance through Medicaid, I can distinctly see how this reform will continue to make things harder on them. The addition of separate regions, PHPs, and increased amount of administrative burden will force these children to go without the medical care they need. For example, I work in a corporation that has offices in three different counties in NC.

Most of them are working in industries such as retail, construction, or food service, but their incomes are too high to qualify for Medicaid and too low to afford health insurance in the private marketplace. Also in NC, if you are a male or a female who is not pregnant and without children, it is next to impossible to get coverage in this income bracket. We really need Medicaid expansion.

For instance, a working adult without children who makes less than $11,880 a year can't get low-cost health insurance or NC Medicaid. Thank God for our Community Health Center.

Loss of CCNC a nationally recognized entity with proven quality and cost containment success. Loss of an efficient Medicaid system, noting that with reimbursements less than ½ of private insurers, the only way pediatricians can continue to see Medicaid patients is with an efficient Medicaid system and the waiver will destroy efficiency causing pediatricians to stop taking Medicaid. This will reduce access to quality care for children, our most vulnerable population. Include any personal stories, if you have them, on how the similar experiment of mental health reform/privatization has not worked in NC, especially with children.

"I request that CMS carefully consider any changes to NC's Medicaid system before moving forward to approve the submitted 1115 waiver. While I recognize that payment reform is coming quickly in all sectors of healthcare, I have great hesitations about the plan submitted by NC, including:
- Administrative burden to participating Medicaid providers. The complexities of having providers align with and report to multiple and overlapping Provider-Led Entities and Managed Care Organizations could cause undo hardship to Medicaid providers, especially smaller independent practices. There is currently over 90% participation rate for primary care in NC, and to keep that we will need statewide, uniform supports to all practices that want to participate.
- Administrative burden and confusion for Patients. Having Medicaid plan options that mirror complicated private market coverage with shifting provider networks and disjointed care coordination seems a burden to patients whose resources are already limited. A system of Navigation may be needed such as we had to create when NC declined a State-run Health Exchange for ACA coverage.
- Dismantling of award-winning, cost-saving, localized infrastructure of Community Care of NC. It is unclear to me what, beyond the State gaining budget predictability by removing their own responsibility to the beneficiaries, is the intent of Medicaid Reform when data-driven cost and quality measures are working in NC and costs are around 50th in the nation for Medicaid spending growth. Require the State to keep Community Care of NC in tact as much as possible if you approve the waiver and want reform to succeed. Both its provider network and its care management services.
-Lack of Medicaid Expansion. Require this to be part of any Medicaid Reform plan that occurs in North Carolina. Why reform twice? Have the system respond to changes in structure and scope simultaneously. Expanding service to those under 100% of poverty level and eliminating the unjustifiable coverage gap should be part of the transformation.

The waiver in Medicaid could possible destroy private practices. Who could afford to stay open when most of the patients have Medicaid but Medicaid doesn't pay??? If Medicaid doesn't pay, people working in health care will get paid less or possibly terminated. How can they afford to feed their families?? It would become a vicious cycle. But, if the government is okay with taking money from hard working American's and making it hard to find health care because Medicaid is shit, then I guess it's ok. Why take healthcare advantages from those that can't afford any other healthcare. Practices won't have any other choice but to limit their services for Medicaid recipients because they would be losing money.

"Requiring North Carolina to expand Medicaid as a condition of the waiver would implement the legislative intent behind the ACA. It also advances national goals to create a healthier population.
Under the ACA, Medicaid expansion was an integral part in order to provide health insurance for the working poor who can't afford to buy the subsidized policies in the exchange. The early experience in other states shows that the new Medicaid enrollees begin getting regular care and start addressing chronic health issues, such as diabetes, hypertension, heart disease and obesity. They are healthier at work and are freed from the fear that one trip to the ER will bankrupt them. By helping the working poor to climb to the middle class, this strengthens communities.
For providers, expansion is necessary to replace some lost federal revenue. With Medicaid receipts, they save money on charity care and can thus consider increasing services.
North Carolina is a national leader in providing high-quality, cost-effective care for Medicaid recipients.
Medicaid expansion is a vital part of creating a healthier, more productive America with greater financial security and lower healthcare expenses for all.

"I work at a pediatric office in NC. I do not support the switch from a single Medicaid to 15 different entities! This will just complicate the process--no longer one set of rules, one insurance card, single place to call for overrides, billing questions, prior approvals, etc.!

"As a medical student, I recently learned that about 40% of patients seen at community health centers in NC are uninsured. By not accepting the Medicaid expansion the state of North Carolina is actively denying healthcare coverage to many of these people who are seeking care as well as thousands more who do not because of the potential cost.

Legislators - do the right thing and help the people of your state access cost-effective, preventative healthcare. Please accept the Medicaid expansion and support community health centers.

I see the struggles that my patients and parents deal with daily navigating the Medicaid system and I see nothing but more problems if the waiver is approved. It is totally unacceptable that a legislative-mandated Medicaid reform waiver survive that addresses nothing but cost savings to the state. As a pediatrician, we all have worked extremely well with Community Care of North Carolina (CCNC) to provide needed cost savings to the state but more importantly greatly improve the quality of care received by the citizens. If the waiver passes, we will be in a survival mode and unfortunately quality will suffer as a result.

"I am a Medicaid recipient, disabled and living on SSI. In the past year I have seen some of my Medicaid benefits disappear. Prescriptions I have been taking for years are being denied to me one by one. The last time I looked over the benefits online, I found that vision tests and eyeglasses are no longer covered. How am I to get those things now? I need glasses badly and my quality of life, which isn't great at present, is suffering because of that. Still living with me is my youngest daughter, who is 24. She would so much love to leave home, but she has never had a job, and any job available to her here would be minimum wage. She can't have Medicaid. Most of NC hasn't enjoyed the recovery from the recession that some folks think we have. There are only spots in the state that have more jobs. The years we've spent here under Republican rule have injured this beautiful place, where I've lived all my life, in many ways. Now our government wants to replace the care we're getting with even worse care. No matter what rosy words they've included in their request, it's all utter bunkum. The idea of cutting costs per person rather than increasing services per person makes me shiver. I really don't know whether the cutbacks in Medicaid that already exist here come from the state or federal level. When we have a for-profit company overseeing our health with the intent of cutting costs, things will only be worse. I am not in favor of that at all. Most of all, we need the Medicaid expansion. There are at least a half-million people here without health insurance. Must they die by the side of the road? Surely some of them have no computer, so I write on their behalf.

This model has saved the state millions and millions in Medicaid dollars over the years that the 14 networks have been in existence. To totally leave this program out of the Medicaid reform plan is about as stupid as the day Governor McCrory and Dr. Vos announced to the media that Medicaid in NC was broken, while that very same day, CCNC received an award for the excellent work the program has done for the Medicaid program in NC. This award was presented by Senator Richard Burr and during that presentation it was revealed that other states were looking to North Carolina and applauding the success of the program. These states wanted to duplicate this managed care model in their own states. Please don't leave out CCNC! Governor McCrory doesn't even know what a jewel CCNC in the care given for its patients.

"North Carolina's Medicaid reform plan lacks the most important change needed to improve health care for North Carolinians and strengthen the provider community — Medicaid expansion! Medicaid coverage should be extended to all adults ages 18-64 with incomes at or below 138% of the Federal Poverty Level (FPL). In North Carolina, expanded Medicaid would cover more than 400,000 people; at least 244,000 of those in the Coverage Gap are uninsured as a result.
In 2014, 43% of all community health center patients in North Carolina were uninsured and more than 70% of patients lived at or below 100% FPL. Community health center staff see firsthand the significant health challenges and barriers to needed services that these uninsured and low-income patients face. In North Carolina, nearly 40,000 women are not receiving recommended preventive screenings, 27,044 diabetics cannot get much needed medications, and 45,500 individuals with depression are not getting the treatment they need. In fact, providers often have to modify treatment plans for uninsured patients because of their inability to afford a specialist visit or pay for needed medications.
With Medicaid expansion, community health centers in North Carolina could better coordinate the full spectrum of care their patients need. Medicaid expansion would also bring new income to the community health centers that would enable them to expand sites and services, hire new staff, and integrate and improve the care they provide.

I do not understand why the NC General Assembly is so set on reforming a program that has proven to reduce costs of care while improving health. Over 70% of Medicaid recipients in NC are children. Children and the pediatric practitioners who care for them will bear the brunt of any changes to a system that is not even broken to begin with. In many rural practices, like the one I worked in the past year, the number of children insured by Medicaid exceeds 75%. Medicaid reimbursement is already less than private insurance that is offset somewhat by timely reimbursement and having to deal with only one insurer -- the state . I fear that with the proposed changes, billing will become an expensive nightmare for practitioners. Recruiting and retaining pediatric practitioners to care for children in need areas is hard enough and I'm afraid the proposed Medicaid waiver will make that task even harder. Practices in more affluent areas will just limit the number of Medicaid patients they admit, but in rural areas where an overwhelming percentage of children are Medicaid insured that will not be possible, so I'm afraid newly minted pediatricians will just go elsewhere - possibly even to other states.",216561,19 Jul 2016 19:47:43

"Dear CMS,

There are nearly 2000 comments submitted by concerned patients, health care providers and advocates almost all expressing horror that a well-managed, cost effective Medicaid program that has broad based support among nearly the entire health care community in North Carolina could be dismantled. Why does the current legislature wish to wash their hands of responsibility for budgeting and managing a $3.5 billion dollar program? It is because of the power of a few well-placed Legislators to force this program into passage. Most legislators I have talked to about their vote in favor of the Waiver have little understanding of the consequences of their vote. The only group that will benefit by this Waiver is the managed care companies that, by law, are awarded over $400 million dollars in management fees to accomplish what currently costs the state 1/3. The people that are affected by your decision to accept the Waiver cannot match the hundreds of thousands of dollars in campaign donations funneled into creating this law. We can write comments, educate and try to affect change. In the political world this amounts to a deaf ear. Our last and best hope is CMS will look at the Waiver with a jaundiced eye as to why it is necessary in the first place. It is bad legislation for the taxpayers of North Carolina and the United States. It is bad legislation for the children and their physician advocates.

My practice is also weary of accepting the increased risk associated with a capitated system. Historically, we have had negative results with this model.

"PART 1 of 2
As a family doctor at a busy urban community health center, I do my best to care for each patient I see that day. While ""Population medicine"" – thinking about the care of our entire community – is important work, it is hard to fit into a day filled with direct patient care. Community Care of North Carolina (CCNC) has been my partner – the partner of so many of us primary care doctors – in improving care for our state's Medicaid patient population.

CCNC helps me to:

1. Keep up with evidence-based guidelines. CCNC lets me know when my patients with asthma, diabetes, heart conditions or strokes are not filling medications. They also lets me know how I am doing compared with other practices on these measures. CCNC even arranges get-togethers of doctors to go over these things.

2. Give the right care at the right time. CCNC lets me know when my patients are showing up at the Emergency Department during business hours with non-urgent problems. They then help patients understand how best to access the most appropriate care.

3. Wrap appropriate services around my most complex patients. For patients with multiple or severe problems that are hospitalized, CCNC staff will visit them – often at home – and make sure they are able to get medicines and can safely get around their home.

4. Have vital information. CCNC has created a ""Provider Portal"" through which I can see the names and numbers of my patients' other doctors or therapists so that we can more easily coordinate care. I can even see the names of the medicines they are filling and the dates they picked it up from which pharmacy.

5. Have direct communication. My local CCNC network's staff has taken the extra (and arduous) steps to become integrated into my system so that they can send me messages about our shared patients directly in that person's electronic medical record.

6. Build relationships around the primary care office. I recently had a patient whose kidneys had taken a turn for the worse. Through a quick phone call to CCNC's Community Pharmacist program, I was able to find out that another doctor had started giving him a medicine around the time he started to have problems. Also I had a patient who needed assistance getting appropriate behavioral health care. At my CCNC network meeting, I ran into exactly the person who could help.

"NC's proposed Medicaid waiver is simply the result of partisan politics at its worst. Multiple independent audits have verified that per beneficiary spend rates are among the lowest, if not the lowest, in the country and the delivery model continues to produce lower medication and hospital readmission rates. Simply put, existing care models are yielding savings and quality outcomes. Yet our legislators want to dismantle this system and introduce expensive administrative duplication and unnecessary complexity. Providers and beneficiaries alike will not be better served by this ill-conceived, gap-riddled waiver. Secretary Brajer has been quoted recently as saying the Medicare system in NC isn't broken. I can fully embrace innovation if there's a reasonable chance patients will be better served and population health improved. The ""system"" outlined in the waiver will leave too many of the neediest patients underserved, while giving out-of-state for-profit insurers a better bottom line.

"Part 2 of 2
The systems and relationships used to achieve all of these successes took years to build. It's an organization for which quality is the goal, not profit. It is hard to understand the goal of our legislature's ""patient-centered"" Medicaid reform. How does disrupting these existing, working relationships help patients? How does allowing private companies to carve profit out of our tax dollars help North Carolina as a whole? How does carving up NC's population into pieces and giving bits to one and bits to another company make any sense? Why has our legislature not offered to expand Medicaid if they think this plan is a good one?

In my 16 years of practice, I have seen private insurance companies make more and more money by giving less care to patients and less money to doctors. My hope is that the federal government will DENY our legislature's request for a waiver to privatize N.C. Medicaid, so that CCNC can continue the good work it's doing and has done for year.

"I am a pediatric nurse in North Carolina. I have seen a lot of changes in the healthcare system in the past 17 years. I feel changing Medicaid from a single Medicaid payor to 15 different payors would be detrimental to not only patients but all pediatric practices.
This change would greatly impact our CCNC program which has grown to be a wonderful cost savings program for our government along with improving patient's continuity of care. The case managers with CCNC have opened up a greater communication between not only the patients, their families and the providers of service but also with community resources unknown to many families and providers.
In the Fall a 5yr old little boy with medicaid visited our practice for a routine kindergarten exam. He failed the hearing exam so our provider referred him out to a local audiologist for further evaluation. This patient was diagnosed with hearing loss and fitted for hearing-aids. He also needed an assistive device for the classroom to help with his learning due to hearing difficulties. Per the school he did not fit the criteria for special needs so the school did not have monies in their budget to purchase the very expensive hearing device for the classroom. The parents did not have resources to purchase this machine so I spoke with our CCNC case manager who began to help investigate this case.
The CCNC case manager made multiple contacts with the Audiologist, family, school and community to locate any possible resources to be able to purchase this equipment for the classroom. She even attended several meetings with the family and school system to discuss the patient's needs and make sure everyone knew what was needed and expected. After multiple calls CCNC nurse manager procured the funds to purchase the machine for the classroom and it will now follow him the through his school career.
Without CCNC, and our current medicaid system our practice would not have been able to act as quickly as we did with the referral process to determine his hearing disability. We would not have had a case manager to coordinate all of the meetings and communication between providers, parents, school system, and community resources. This child now has a greater opportunity to learn and become a productive adult because of the way our system is able to help children and families. I beg that you do not disrupt our currently working system. Stephanie Deaton RN, Pediatric nurse for 17 years",216621,19 Jul 2016 21:11:26
"I am a pediatrician in Moore and Hoke Counties on North Carolia. I love our Community Care of NC Medicaid program. We take care of over 20,000 children on Medicaid and CHIP. I have extensively used our community-based care coordinators. After practicing at a we funded children's hospital in Washington, I had concerns on how I would be able to coordinate community care in my new practice. Our community care program has allowed be to coordinate social resources that support fragile infants that have multiple health care needs and make sure that their families have the resources and support they need to care for their children. Our nurses go into these families homes, explain their medications and medical equipment, and ensure that the children have transportation to their appointments. These nurses have also gone to the homes of my morbidly obese teen ages to help clean out their pantries and help them improve their home health environments so they are not led to sequelae that with make them burdensome to the adult medication community.

Our children establish health behaviors at a young age. It is of great importance that we support programs that will nurture their health and development. Prevention of disease and the establishment of healthy habits will make adults that have fewer preventable illnesses and reduce health care spending overall.

I have reviewed the proposed 1115 Waiver proposal of the NC Department of Health and Human Services. I am opposed to your approving this waiver because I do not think private insurance companies can reinvent Community Care. Under Community Care, we work with one payer and one community-based care coordination system. Our current system is more efficient and supports practices focusing on the promotion of health care. Let's focus on what is important and not replace a slightly imperfect system with what we can see as clearly inefficient. Please turn down the 1115 Waiver proposal of the NC Department of Health and Human Services and support health being the actual caring for of people health!",216625,19 Jul 2016 21:25:18
"NC Medicaid reform will not be truly transformative and innovative unless we
close the Coverage Gap so that low-wage working adults, children and families, and residents of rural
and underserved communities have access to quality health care. Multiple reports provide evidence that
Medicaid expansion addresses concerns such as bolstering the health care workforce, strengthening the
financial viability of safety net providers, and improving provider engagement. Most importantly, the
waiver states the need to improve community health, which is hard to achieve and sustain if 500,000
North Carolinians are left without health coverage. Please do the right thing for all North Carolinians' sake and expand Medicaid.",216629,19 Jul 2016 22:14:37

"North Carolina's Medicaid reform plan lacks the most important change needed to improve health care for North Carolinians and strengthen the provider community — Medicaid expansion! Medicaid coverage should be extended to all adults ages 18-64 with incomes at or below 138% of the Federal Poverty Level (FPL). In North Carolina, expanded Medicaid would cover more than 400,000 people; at least 244,000 of those in the Coverage Gap are uninsured as a result.
In 2014, 43% of all community health center patients in North Carolina were uninsured and more than 70% of patients lived at or below 100% FPL. Community health center staff see firsthand the significant health challenges and barriers to needed services that these uninsured and low-income patients face. In North Carolina, nearly 40,000 women are not receiving recommended preventive screenings, 27,044 diabetics cannot get much needed medications, and 45,500 individuals with depression are not getting the treatment they need. In fact, providers often have to modify treatment plans for uninsured patients because of their inability to afford a specialist visit or pay for needed medications.
With Medicaid expansion, community health centers in North Carolina could better coordinate the full spectrum of care their patients need. Medicaid expansion would also bring new income to the community health centers that would enable them to expand sites and services, hire new staff, and integrate and improve the care they provide.",216665,20 Jul 2016 06:00:37

"As a North Carolinian, registered voter, public health advocate, and taxpayer, I am disappointed with North Carolina's proposed plan to reform the Medicaid program. I believe the state has ignored NC citizens and communities and have gone forward with a proposal based on their own agendas. For the past three years, many North Carolinians have asked for Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act. States that have expanded Medicaid are states with better health outcomes. I want to live in a state that chooses better health outcomes. The state has done a poor job of providing options and addressing health inequity in NC communities, and Medicaid expansion would be a step in the right direction to improving our healthcare system. Please require the state to expand Medicaid if they want to move forward with this plan.

Also with this plan, as an HIV/AIDS health advocate and professional, I would like to see more funding put towards HIV case management. People living with HIV are shown to have better treatment adherence and more likely to achieve viral suppression. This reform also needs to require Medicaid/Medicare physicians to adopt routine HIV testing for preventive measures. Many primary care providers do not offer HIV testing as a routine examination and the CDC has recommended all people, ages 13-64 to be routinely tested no matter race, sex, or risk factor. This will decrease the amount of late stage diagnoses in NC (being diagnosed with AIDS within the first 12 months of initial HIV diagnosis and can lead to serious health complications or death) and also reduce stigma about HIV. Hepatitis C testing and treatment should also be made a priority in this reform.

This reform also needs to include a developed plan around substance use treatment with funding and quality measures that ensure quality treatment, that is harm reduction focused not abstinence based.",216725,20 Jul 2016 09:01:02

"From prior experience working with managed Medicaid care in Tennessee and the behavioral health LMEs in North Carolina, I ask that you seriously reconsider contracting the Medicaid program out to vendors. The result of managed Medicaid programs is a patchwork of billing rules, administrative processes, and credentialing paperwork that make it nearly impossible for providers to conduct business with Medicaid. Every contractor has different forms, different coding edits, different timely filing rules. Not to mention, contractors are unaccountable for the problems or inefficiencies in the program. Haven't we learned our lesson from NCTracks/CSC. They don't care about the people of North Carolina.

I can assure you that if you move forward with turning our Medicaid program into this managed care mess, providers will dis-enroll in droves. But, that's probably what you want because your only concern is saving money.",216753,20 Jul 2016 09:34:48

Our practice currently accepts Medicaid with no restrictions, and we have found working with CCNC to be extremely helpful for some of our most challenging patients. Like most of my peers, I view caring for children as a calling and am committed to helping them regardless of their means. However, like many independent practices, we are truly struggling. My accountant tells me we have a ""bare bones"" budget. We have decreased staff over the last year-- as a small business owner and job provider, this pains me greatly. Despite this, our schedules are full and my colleagues and I routinely work at least 13 hour days. If Medicaid reform further cuts reimbursements to pediatric providers- who are already the lowest paid of all physician specialties and receive 70% of Medicare rates for Medicaid patient care-- it will further affect my staff and our ability to provide care. This is not just fear; this is fact. We do have information based on Medicaid privatization from other states, and the indications are that payments are delayed, and that the system does not work as well as what we have in place with CCNC. I would likely have to cap our percentage of Medicaid patients, which I am loathe to do.

"I am a life long North Carolina resident from a transitioning rural county, a member of both the Board of Directors of Planned Parenthood Votes South Atlantic and Planned Parenthood Votes! South Atlantic, and the mother of two daughters. I am deeply concerned about the barriers women and families in my state face to receive quality medical care and the great need for access to quality family planning services, particularly among those receiving Medicaid. Any attempt to obtain a waiver of the current family planning free choice of provider protections ensuring that a patient can receive family planning services from any willing Medicaid-participating provider and ensuring that Planned Parenthood as a Medicaid provider is not wrongfully excluded from the program would result in harm to many of our most vulnerable residents. I ask that CMS explicitly clarify that Medicaid enrollees remain entitled to seek family planning services from any willing Medicaid provider and reaffirm that Planned Parenthood as a Medicaid-participating family planning provider is not excluded. It is also of concern that the waiver also does not specify that women may elect to have an obstetrical or gynecological (OB/GYN) provider as their primary care provider. OB/GYN providers, including women's health centers like Planned Parenthood, play a central role in the health care of women. Low-income women, in particular, tend to rely on reproductive health care providers as their primary (or only) source of care, or as pivotal entry points to the broader health care system and essential health care resources, such as behavioral health and social supports. Reproductive health providers, including PP, routinely fill the role of primary health care provider. In North Carolina, 54 percent of pregnancies are unintended. Reducing unintended pregnancy rates and improving birth outcomes avoid use of more intensive health care services, can reduce the need for long-term engagements in the health care system, and save money. Federal law explicitly entitles Medicaid enrollees to family planning services and family planning providers. It is critical and necessary under the law that CMS work with North Carolina to ensure that all Medicaid enrollees participating in PCHCs have timely access to all state-covered family planning services and supplies from the family planning provider of their choice.

"I see no need for this proposed Medicaid reform. There are changes that should be made but capitated prepaid health plans would not be a good one. According to the public notice the transformation and reorganization of NC Medicaid eligibility would not change except for parents of children in foster care. So nothing is really changing expect doctor's will be receiving less money which could turn into to some doctor's not accepting Medicaid. People are under the assumption that more people will be eligible for Medicaid which is not what I got from what has been presented. The reform should be making sure Medicaid is used appropriately with how it is used now. I previously worked for an Emergency Department and patient's with Medicaid will utilize the ED before going to their primary care doctor for a cold. That is abusing federal dollars. So capping what it paid to doctor's is not the solution. The solution would be to educate patient on the healthcare system. Teach them how to utilize primary care doctors versus using the Emergency Department and the benefits of it. This reform is a cop out and shows the laziness of DHHS. Are changes needed..yes! Is this reform the change we need? No!!!! I do not support this waiver and recommended changes…. 90% of pediatricians currently accept medicaid in NC, which pays 75% medicare rates. Further reduction in reimbursement, which will likely happen, to rates 50-60% of what private payers currently pay would lead to pediatricians not accepting medicaid, and lead to a lack of access of patients who will get their care at emergency rooms, driving up the cost of healthcare overall.

"As a North Carolinian and the mother of a disabled child, I want to voice my concerns about the Medicaid reform plans. First, the plan is unclear and full of confusing rules. Medicaid recipients and families already struggle with mountains of paperwork and rules in addition to the level of care required in their homes. Our time is precious and scarce. My husband and I both work full time in addition to caring for our son. We are not professional medical billing/insurance workers and dealing with the legal paperwork takes a lot of time that we would rather spend with our child. It is wrong to impose undue burdens. Secondly, the model of proposed regions is a bad idea. Many disabled people require special levels of care and just the right providers. Limiting the disabled to care in a region is counterproductive to their care and could, in some cases, be deadly. I also find this rule discriminatory. People who have private or employer-sponsored insurance in addition to Medicaid would have a greater ability to seek care across regions. This would create different classes of recipients with drastically different access to proper care. Thirdly, the possible cancellation of NC HIPP is a bad idea for both families and taxpayers. For families, this helps to offset employer-sponsored insurance premiums in households that are already spending money on care in many ways that typical households do not, for example in inflated utility costs. For taxpayers, this helps to limit the burden on the Medicaid program by keeping people on employer-sponsored insurance as their first level of claims. These proposed plans are deeply problematic and do not seem to have the best interest of recipients as their focus. As a voter, I ask you to consider these policies with the best interests of the recipients and the state in mind and to understand that these policies deeply affect our day to day lives and the care and accommodations that we can provide for our
children.

I hope that Medicaid Expansion will happen in NC. It is not economically sound nor morally acceptable to turn down health care for our citizens who make too little money to qualify for Medicaid and too much money to qualify for Medicaid with its current income requirement.

"My name is Beverly Edwards, and I am a pediatrician born, raised and educated through medical school here in North Carolina. I have been in general pediatric practice in Ahoskie, NC as the sole owner of Ahoskie Pediatrics for the last 25yrs. I have adhered to the mission of my Medical school, ECU,by proving primary care in a rural setting.

My practice here flourished, and I am proud to say we have had one of the highest vaccination rates in the state and that we have been trusted to c

are for our county's foster children and that we have been able to coordinate the care of complex patients with specialists across

North Carolina and Virginia.

Starting in 2013, my practice began to feel the sting of our state not adopting the ACA as mandated. We put a lot of money into being sure we attested and did receive the federal money for that effort. We did not get the Medicaid rate increase to Medicare standards until mid-2014. By then we were financially embarrassed and never sure that we'd received appropriate reparations. The rate decrease to former Medicaid rates in 2015 sped up our financial decline. Now, in 2016, my practice has been pared down by one NP, two full-time nurses
and less hours for our part time support staff.
I hang on, because in addition to my own children,who are getting their higher education, I have over 2000 babies, children and adolescents to provide medical care for, 70-80% are Medicaid patients. I have not and will not refuse to take new Medicaid patients.
I appreciate the help I've been given by Brody School of Medicine, Vidant Hospital System, the NC Pediatric Society and the NC Peds Council. I would not have been able to keep my practice open thus far without them. CCNC has played a very valuable role in our practice: we serve four counties and awesome outreach is available to our patients. Whether in Hertford, Bertie, Gates or Northampton County, our patients are keeping their appointments with our office or their specialists, having their medicines reviewed regularly for compliance and generally staying healthier. CCNC is not broken! It really works in the rural areas.
Thank you for any time and attention you give my remarks .",216869,20 Jul 2016 11:21:07

"I am a mental health services researcher and have a long history studying mental health care and mental health reform in North Carolina since completing my PhD at NCSU in 1987. I am for the expansion of Medicaid as it will increase access to mental health care as well as primary health care for so many people. Expanding access to mental health care is especially critical. However, I am AGAINST the current plan which proposed to move Medicaid to managed care plans and continues the current preference for privatization of vital services. I think we have enough evidence from the past 10 years of mental health care reform and privatization that the private sector DOES NOT provide adequate care. The incentives are to manage the costs, and not manage the care. There are some exceptions of course (for example Cardinal seems to do a reasonable job), but by and by, any plan which allows for profit by private companies has strong incentives to minimize care and offer short term solutions to complex, long term problems.",216881,20 Jul 2016 12:21:02

"I would like to add that a recent article outlines participation rates of urologists in Medicaid. The best participation rates 80-100% correlate with states that do not use MCO's to manage Medicaid, and the lowest rates correlate with states that have broad MCO coverage. DHHS has already highlighted the problem that North Carolina already has poor urological coverage throughout rural parts of the state, and I expect this would worsen with low participation rates due to MCO management, as is shown in the article by Overholser et. al, in Journal of Urology Practice, vol.3, 276-282, July 2016. From this point of view, it does not make sense to transition to MCO management.",216889,20 Jul 2016 12:49:28
"I consider it essential that the state facilitate affordable access to health care to the low-income North Carolinians who fall in the gap between Medicaid eligibility and the insurance subsidies available through the Affordable Care Act. What justifies Medicaid expansion above all is that it would be an invaluable investment in the general wellbeing of the state and all of its citizens.

Almost half a million people fall in the gap, which means that either they don't seek care when they should or they turn to emergency rooms. Both options involve costs that it would be shortsighted for the state to ignore. Delayed treatment results in more expensive medical care for the affected individual; if he or she is employed, it results in reduced productivity and absenteeism; and if he or she has a family, it can place greater financial and psychological stress on the home. The emergency-room option results in unreimbursed costs to a medical system already overburdened, and it turns resources away from the emergencies that ERs are meant to handle.

One-fourth of the people who fall in the gap are children. It benefits no one in the state—from the poorest person to the wealthiest—to leave children with medical problems untreated. Children with treatable diseases and physical injuries who are not provided care may well become an ever-greater burden on society as they make their way toward adulthood. And children in this situation may find their lives turned into a misery from which they cannot recover. That outcome cannot be warranted by any meaningful social ethos.",216893,20 Jul 2016 12:56:04

The current Medicaid system in NC, Community Care of NC, is excellent at meeting the dual needs of limiting costs, providing access and providing excellent care to the neediest citizens on our state. I am writing to strongly advise that this requested waiver NOT be approved. Our current system works and is solidly in place. The proposed change over to private entities does NOT make sense and will be costly and disruptive. Anyone knowledgeable about the current system believes in its effectiveness and value.

"I am responding to the North Carolina proposed 1115 Medicaid waiver. I am a full-time practicing pediatrician in Raleigh, NC. I am concerned that the proposed fundamental change to Medicaid will bring unnecessary and unwanted added bureaucracy to a system that in its current state has shown over the past 5 years consistent improvements in care while lowering the overall per member cost. Community Care of NC (CCNC), as the management organization for Medicaid, has proven itself to be able to lower costs while providing improvement in health outcomes. CCNC is touted nationwide as a model for how to manage care. To eliminate this organization and replace it with multiple competing organizations make no sense to most of us practicing pediatricians.
Practicing pediatricians lean heavily on CCNC for its expertise. They are keenly aware of the special services many of our patients need to stay in good health and develop as well as possible. We have a real fear that private insurance company managers are not going to have that expertise making the authorization for needed services or tests much more difficult to obtain. We fear that this will add cost and time to us and our staff. This will be even more cumbersome if we have to deal with a number of managed care companies.
Most of us who care for special needs children, that is children with complex medical problems, feel a genuine need to help these children who deserve the best care they can get. The reality is that we also need to receive adequate pay for our time and services. Under the proposal, it is likely that we will get less pay for even more time that will be needed to be invested on our patients' behalf.
To abandon the system we have in North Carolina, and replace it with a much more cumbersome one simply does not make sense. Keeping the important work of a model system such as CCNC and actually expanding Medicaid would do much more to improve health care and health outcomes for the children of North Carolina.

"Uninsured North Carolinians who are less healthy raise families who are less healthy. The burden of care (for the uninsured) falls in various ways and places throughout North Carolina communities, but this burden falls exponentially throughout the state in schools, clinics, hospitals, and worksites. Local and county clinics provide care for people who would be in better health, and require much less critical, complicated care had they only been receiving regular, comprehensive care through routine visits to health care providers. Illness spreads through public schools because children don't have access to primary care medicine to easily diagnose and treat common illness. Hospitals and clinics close because they can't turn critically ill people away, yet their margins can't absorb high costs of their care. Premiums of the already insured rise to cover costs absorbed by the system. Regardless of the position one takes on health care being a right or a privilege, surely common sense dictates that it's more logical (not to mention more humane!) for people to have guaranteed access to primary care. As a state and as a society, we pay upstream, or we pay downstream. And downstream, when we're paying to address problems compounded by effects of longterm poor health and untreated illness, is far more expensive. The costs of NOT expanding Medicaid are tremendous; they have ripple effects throughout our state. Expand Medicaid because it the right thing to do, and because it is the logical thing to do. Expanding access to Medicaid ensures that ALL North Carolina taxpayers will benefit from living among a healthier population. Healthier North Carolinians can focus on living productive lives that will move our state ever forward.",216937,20 Jul 2016 15:23:49

"UNFUNDED MANDATES
Comments with respect to the North Carolina Medicaid and NC Health Choice Draft Section 1115 Waiver Application
Disclaimer, I am both a provider of I/DD services (for twenty (20) years) and currently provide services through the NC Innovations Waiver and a I am the father of a 24 year old man with Autism who receives services through this waiver.
North Carolina I/DD providers have not received a Medicaid rate increase since 2001 (the exception being State institutions and ICFs). By not performing annual cost findings and adjusting Medicaid rates accordingly, the State has not issued rate increases annually for the last fifteen (15) years. During this period, the State has mandated over seventeen (17) mandates (national accreditation, malpractice insurance, additional clinical tasks, etc.) that have increased our operational costs by approximately 30%.
To pay for these unfunded mandates, providers are unable to pay their employees who actually work one-on-one with our disabled clients a livable wage. North Carolina I/DD Providers pay is less that what we were paying in 2001.
Before North Carolina needs to conduct a cost finding analysis of her provider network to assure we are either compensated for these mandates or the mandate is removed to enable us to pay the people doing the hands on service are paid a wage that matches the skills and abilities required for this service delivery.

"The biggest concern I have with the proposed reform is eliminating NCHIPP. I have a medically fragile 1 year old that receives private insurance and Medicaid. In her first year of life her private insurance paid out over $1 million in claims before Medicaid was ever billed. NCHIPP reimburses our family for the insurance premiums which saves our family a great deal of money and without the program, we would not be able to insure our child. Thus that would increase the claims submitted to Medicaid.

Our other concern is cresting districts to receive Medicaid services. At this point our daughter receives her cate in our props ed territory. However with her condition we have considered seeking second opinions elsewhere in the state and possibly changing her specialist care.

"To Whom it May Concern,

I am a private practice pediatrician who currently has the honor and privilege of serving patients primarily from Alamance and Orange counties in North Carolina. Our practice is the largest provider of pediatric primary care in a service area of around a quarter of a million people, and around a third or more of the children and youths we see in our practice are insured through our state Medicaid program.

Having been with my practice for a little over a year now, I happily found that my efforts to advocate for the health care needs of our Medicaid patients were very well supported by our local Community Care of North Carolina (CCNC) network. This support was something I had been able to rely on during my previous work as a pediatric resident and fellow in Durham County. The work that CCNC does with patients supplements what our patients, their families, and us in the provider community are able to accomplish within the walls of the clinic, by providing follow-up, education, and coordination of care to which they likely would not otherwise have access.

However, I am fearful that the community-based, provider-led, and ground-level CCNC networks that to date have served our most vulnerable children and youths in the Medicaid population will be demolished and replaced by an ineffective, fragmented, and top-down approach to community health upon the approval of this waiver in its current form. Not only that, the waiver in its current form will lead to a restriction in access to care, dissatisfaction and increased administrative burden to providers, and a dismantling of a system that has been shown by the data to create a downwards pressure on the cost curve for the general Medicaid population.

"Having been in healthcare for 23 years, it baffles me how anyone can think the Medicaid waiver proposal will improve a system that is currently a nationally recognized, award winning system that actually works. CCNC has been a national example of an organization that works well with both physician and patient for care and lower cost. As a manager of a large pediatric practice with over 20,000 Medicaid lives, I can speak from first hand experience, that the current system works and works extremely well. It has 100% physician buy-in, which is a essential for any system to succeed. The proposed waiver is such a bureaucratic mess that it will be impossible for patients to understand the new system. At hearings and via comment, there has been nearly 99% disapproval of the system proposed in the waiver. The Medicaid population, due to socio economic concerns, is in general a higher risk, lower educated patient pool with many barriers to care already. Those who wrote this waiver obviously rarely see their own doctor, let alone understand the barriers they are creating for this patient pool to receive care. As a medicaid patient, why figure out this mess? Just go to the ER. We hear that they'll have patient counselors to call the patients and advise them of their options? Really? In a system where addresses and phone numbers change monthly, they expect to identify and help these people? They expect that Big Brother insurance company no where near NC, taking profits from NC, will go the extra mile to help this population? The red tape alone will make things impossible for the patients as well as the physicians to provider care.

CCNC's partnership with DME works!!! It's at the grass roots level, in our practices, in our communities, providing care, helping people in a way that proposed plan can't. The politicians want to be able to sell a system and claim an accomplishment. If our current system, with CCNC and DME working hand in hand goes away, you won't be able to bring it back. You can't recreate 30 years of effort by DME and pediatricians to create one of the best systems in the county. Please don't loose sight of the goal, which is to provide quality, cost effective care. To have healthy adults, you must have healthy children!!! The 1115 will guarantee a failure in cost and care and to this population for YEARS!!!

"As a rural family physician in North Carolina I have four serious concerns about the North Carolina Medicaid Reform proposal.

1) Dismantling the nationally recognized Community Care of North Carolina in favor of for profit insurance companies will increase costs for services, decrease provider reimbursement, and increase the complexity of filing Medicaid claims. I believe that these factors will further limit the number of physicians who do not cap the percentage of their patients who are on Medicaid.

2) There is no plan to expand Medicaid coverage for the working poor who do not qualify for the insurance exchanges.

3) There are multiple references to telemedicine as a means of improving access to care however the waiver does not clearly support parity in reimbursement for care provided via telemedicine. Additionally, under current NC Medicaid policy, RHCs and FQHCs cannot be the distant site in a telemedicine encounter and changing this is not addressed in the waiver. If this change is not made we will not be able to see the full potential of telemedicine/telehealth in our state.

4) One of the essential tenets of school-based health centers is that all students are able to be seen regardless of their ability to pay. When I made the recommendation that SBHCs be recognized as essential providers during the listening sessions it si due to my concern that all of the new Medicaid insurers will not include all SBHCs in their contracts. Therefore, while the SBHC will continue to see all students, they may not receive reimbursement from all Medicaid insurers and therefore their ability to be self sustaining will decrease.",216997,20 Jul 2016 19:15:47
"I have copied and pasted the conclusion to a report on the situation regarding Medicaid. Nothing in the proposed Medicaid Reform Demonstration will provide healthcare for 500,000 NC citizens who currently lack medical insurance and, thereby, adequate healthcare. And, in fact, this proposed Medicaid Reform Demonstratio will limit healthcare to those fortunate NC citizens who now have Medicaid by rationing the healthcare available to them now. In the interest of making an honest effort to improve healthcare in NC, please reconsider the proposed Medicaid Reform Demonstration.

"" the Quadruple Aim and initiatives outlined in the 1115 waiver application are commendable, failing to expand Medicaid will prevent NC DHHS from achieving its goals. North Carolina lawmakers and NC DHHS are ignoring that NC Medicaid reform will not be truly transformative and innovative unless we close the Coverage Gap so that low-wage working adults, children and families, and residents of rural and underserved communities have access to quality health care. Multiple reports provide evidence that Medicaid expansion addresses concerns such as bolstering the health care workforce, strengthening the nancial viability of safety net providers, and improving provider engagement. Most importantly, the waiver states the need to improve community health, which is hard to achieve and sustain if 500,000 North Carolinians are le without health coverage.

Since the NC Legislature & Governor have refused any serious consideration of Medicaid expansion, we have a coverage gap of up to 500,000 North Carolinians eligible for Medicaid under ACA.

"I am a Pediatrician in Western NC. DO NOT APPROVE THE WAIVER. PLEASE DO NOT RUIN THE EXISTING MEDICAID SYSTEM, AND THE ACCESS CARE PROGRAM. .North Carolina has had a long history of having an excellent Medicaid program. It has been very cost-effective, and is envied by many states throughout the country. The Medicaid program on the pediatric side, has partnered together to drastically improve cost-effectiveness of Medicaid for pediatric patient care. I was one of the first Pediatricians in a pilot program as part of Access Care.

When we first put this group together, consisting of nine and then later 12 pediatric practices, we had unblinded results in 12 or 14 different areas showing comparative cost. We all helped each other out so that those with higher cost s were mentored by those who had lower-cost, those that had better results would help those who had less favorable clinical results. It was a team to work together to try to reduce the costs, and increased the quality of care for these Medicaid patients. And it worked.

This makes no sense to me to throw out all of the good work we did for years to lower the cost of care.

"In a small county, I am concerned when I see 15 physicians leave medicine, with no replacements, the writing is on the wall. One third of all physicians are 60 now, and we want to get out as soon as possible, and the prospects of replacements are limited. We cannot continue to lose pediatricians who care for our patients. Reversing many decades of the opposite findings, in 2012, a large independent nonpartisan survey had shown that 90% of physicians were advising their children not to go into medicine. With further changes in healthcare, and attitudes over the past four years this has only worsened, and very few physicians recommend their children go into medicine. That says a lot.

Years ago I attended a Pediatric Meeting in Gatlinburg, and discovered there were no pediatricians left in that 5 county area. The ""TennCare"" fiasco had driven them out - they left the State.

In recent years, Connecticut fired their MCOs and went back to saving money with their State managing their fee-for-service Medicaid, with a model similar to CCNC! And yet we are about to replicate the Tennessee fiasco I described, and abandon our existing Medicaid program to create a system that Connecticut found was more costly!

In an attempt to reduce bureaucracy, what is being proposed will exponentially increase the bureaucratic nightmare and waste.

Do we really want to do this in NC ??

The medical home providers are the foundation for pediatric care, and are being financially squeezed out.

"Here is the view from Pediatrics: The grim reality is that we have to be financially solvent to assure access to quality healthcare. The ACA Medicare parity payments ended in December of 2014, and the Meaningful use incentive funds end soon, leaving us with a significant loss, approaching 30% cut in revenues. Overhead has significantly increased. ADDING THE INCREASED BURDEN OF 9-12 MEDICAID CONTRACTS WILL ADD FURTHER TO OUR OVERHEAD COSTS!

Do we get rid of our triage nurses and just tell ALL patients to come in if they are sick or have a question - less overhead costs, more office visit revenue, but more costs to the Medicaid system!

Do we close on weekends and send 40-50 patients per weekend to the ERs at 5 to 10 times the cost compared to the office?

Do we limit the number of complicated Medicaid patients that take more time? Who will take care of the complex children? ERs?

Do we limit the number or completely stop seeing Medicaid patients?

Or do we just close the practice entirely, which is what many pediatricians have done.

All of these situations are untenable. As you can see - we are worried!!

We need, at a minimum, a payment floor of the higher CPT code reimbursement rate of parity with Medicare, or the Medicaid fee schedule. There are just a few codes where Medicaid is higher.

DO NOT INCREASE OUR ADMINISTRATIVE BURDEN WITH MULTIPLE CARRIERS ADMINISTERING MEDICAID.

"We in Catawba county are in the Unifour Area, which is made up of the following counties: Catawba, Burke, Caldwell and Alexander. The Unifour area is split into two proposed regions, and then we routinely refer patients to physicians in the Winston area, which adds a third region to manage.

This system is going to increase our costs tremendously. In a year or two after this is set up and implemented, we all will be thinking and saying"" ""won't we save a lot of money with centralized billing, fees and contracts, think of all of the administrative costs we will save for practices and for the State"".

Let's think ahead!!

The proposed system will cause undue administrative costs to the practices and inefficiencies will abound for practices and the State. We will need to hire additional staff to assist with administration of all of the complex contracts, and with the multiple regions, that means many more contracts.

Primary care Pediatric practices are financially fragile. We must have parity with Medicare, or the highest per CPT of Medicare or Medicaid fee schedules - there are a very few codes where Medicaid is paid more. We take care of patients 7 days a week, to keep children out of Urgent cares and ERs. It is the right thing to do, and it is quality care for our patients. If we cannot afford to see patients on weekend hours due to low reimbursements, financial decisions rather than quality decisions will have to rule, and we will have to stop weekend clinics and send our patients to the more expensive urgent cares and ERs.
We have many complex patients in our practice. With prepaid plans, there will be an incentive to have the least complex patients as a part of your patient population. Who will care for our complex children? How often will the acuity level of the practice be analyzed? With newborns joining our practice daily, we add very complex children. Should the acuity level and proposed PMPM follow the complex patient? How will this be decided? Don't make it an incentive for practices to dump the patients that are more complex and take much more time to see than ""normal"" patients.

We care for each child like they are our own. Will others?

If this reform goes through, you will witness a devastation of primary care practices. The medical home will not survive. You will be destroying the collaborative system that is in place between practices with Access Care and CCNC.

"As a private pediatrician in North Carolina I have very pleased with the current Medicaid system. When finishing residency I had the opportunity to work in Tennessee. Due to their managed care system, and the trouble physicians experienced, I chose to stay in North Carolina. A major change to our current Medicaid system would put undo burden on our small practice. We would not be able to add additional staff to manage multiple payers. We love all our patients and would hate to turn them away because of insurance reasons. I became a pediatrician to help children in eastern North Carolina please do not take away that opportunity by approving this waiver.",217037,20 Jul 2016 20:55:20
"Do not let this happen to a program that is a model for many states! Do you realize how many people in other states comment about the impressive Medicaid system and physician/State collaborative that is currently in place in NC?

Do not approve this waiver. It will limit access to patient care with multiple regions for one practice, difficulty to make referrals to specialists in other regions, difficulty to keep continuity of care with specialists for patients since birth. It will increase practice expenses to manage the administrative burden of sorting through patient care rules of prior auth, formularies, fee schedules, filing claims, working denials, and trying to find a representative to answer questions for multiple carriers administering the Medicaid contracts..

We should take a step back and look around!

For many years, Pediatrics has been working through the efficiencies and benchmarks to make us run the leanest possible for patient care costs. There isn't more to incentivize to gain lower operational costs. It is unfortunate that those decision makers do not see this.

Maybe pediatrics (0-21) should be carved out of the multiple managed care plans.

How can the decision makers not understand that this is a ridiculously expensive mistake?

"North Carolina's Medicaid reform plan lacks the most important change needed to improve health care for North Carolinians and strengthen the provider community — Medicaid expansion! Medicaid coverage should be extended to all adults ages 18-64 with incomes at or below 138% of the Federal Poverty Level (FPL). In North Carolina, expanded Medicaid would cover more than 400,000 people; at least 244,000 of those in the Coverage Gap are uninsured as a result.
As a former employee in a local health department and a community health center, I have spent 37 years working in public health in NC. I have seen the benefits of Medicaid to many, mainly pregnant women and children. I also worked as a certified application counselor for the Affordable Care Act during the first two years of its inception. I saw how that also benefited even more people but I also saw the heartache and despair when I had to tell people that they were too poor to benefit from these programs because NC chose not to expand Medicaid. Community health center staff see firsthand the significant health challenges and barriers to needed services that these uninsured and low-income patients face. In North Carolina, nearly 40,000 women are not receiving recommended preventive screenings, 27,044 diabetics cannot get much needed medications, and 45,500 individuals with depression are not getting the treatment they need. In fact, providers often have to modify treatment plans for uninsured patients because of their inability to afford a specialist visit or pay for needed medications. This is not the type of health care these residents deserve.
Don't let North Carolina's Medicaid program leaving out the most important change for our state's health. We need North Carolina to expand Medicaid!
NC does not need to privatize Medicaid--this state has an excellent care management program in the Community Care of NC. This program started as a pilot in Cabarrus County (the county in which I worked) and was so effective, it was extended to the rest of the state. Other states would visit NC to see how well this program worked at improving the health of its participants while decreasing costs. Other states would then model this program when they returned to their respective state. Instead of continuing and expanding this program, the State wants to throw it out and start with a private physicians and insurance companies who have not shown any success in this area.
I would recommend against accepting this proposed",217049,20 Jul 2016 21:10:03
"We have great relationships with our CCNC imbedded nurse manager. She assists our practitioners and our patients at an early point when a problem is discovered, difficulty in the patient making their specialist visits, or assisting parents with compliance to care plans.

Our billing staff can pick up the phone and talk with the our DMA regional consultant to discuss proper billing needed to obtain reimbursement by following the billing guidelines. If this is passed, there will be a roster of representatives to call.

It will be a nightmare if our one system is replaced with 5 to 15 insurance contracts.

We are adding complexity, and layers of red tape.

Keep it Simple!

"I am honored to serve as the medical director of a community health center in North Carolina. I see firsthand the burden experienced by people too poor to qualify for government-subsidized insurance from the ACA marketplace. Though our state's community health centers provide a wonderful primary care safety net for those fortunate to live in proximity to these centers, many of those we serve can't afford even the discounted medications available to them at our center, and they often do without. And when services beyond primary care are required, when people need specialty medical and surgical care, this can be very difficult, if not impossible to obtain for those of low income and lacking insurance. For the benefit of all in our communities, North Carolina should be required to make Medicaid expansion a centerpiece of healthcare reform, as wisely envisioned in the Affordable Care Act. Additionally, I am concerned about the emphasis in the NC proposal on having for-profit companies compete for the state's Medicaid contracts. NC is fortunate to have in Community Care of North Carolina (CCNC) a statewide, non-profit care management organization that has engaged and supported local practitioners in providing high quality, cost effective care to North Carolinians covered by Medicaid. CCNC has gained national recognition (most recently including the Hearst Health Prize) for its innovation, promotion of best practices to drive quality health outcomes, sophisticated utilization review and management, and cost savings. It is inconceivable to me that the NC Medicaid reform plan would not accord an essential and central role to this locally developed and managed organization which has a proven track record for serving so well the interests of NC Medicaid consumers and providers.",217057,20 Jul 2016 21:23:37
"""NO""
It is a simple word. Easy to say, easy to write. Yet if applied to the NC Medicaid Waiver, those two little letters will save the country's most inovative and successful Medicaid Program!
And, it will demonstrate to the rest of the country that CMS is not afraid to tell a state what they can and cannot do with Federal Healthcare dollars! Do not approve the 1115 Waiver just as a way of funneling money back to hospitals for uncompensated care - if the State wants that money they should expand Medicaid! Pediatric Healthcare will fall apart if the waiver is approved! Please do not sacrifice the children so the legislature will not have to expand Medicaid. Approving this waiver will reward bad behavior with irresponsible CMS behavior!

"To whom it may concern,

Having practiced Radiology in North Carolina for thirty four years, I am writing to request that the current Medicaid Reform Plan be rejected as it is incomplete and limited in scope by not including Medicaid expansion thereby excluding 300 -500,00 of it's citizens from needed and in many cases life saving care. I have personally seen the emotional and monetary consequences of late diagnosis of cancer and chronic diseases such as heart and diabetes due to lack to accessibility to health care including access to potentially life saving imaging procedures. A health care plan which potentially excludes up to one half million of it's most vulnerable citizens should not be allowed to stand.

"I am a Pediatrician who has served Medicaid patients in the Triangle area for over 20 years.
The proposed NC Medicaid Reform does not meet the basic criteria for a 1115 waiver, because is does not increase or improve the access or quality of medical care currently provided to our NC Medicaid population.
The proposed plan should be rejected.",217069,20 Jul 2016 21:45:06
"I am a health services researcher who has surveyed N.C. Medicaid populations since 1996 to determine access, satisfaction, & utilization of health care. Since about 1999 my research team used the CAHPS instruments. From 1996 until about 2000 NC Medicaid ran a pilot project in Mecklenburg County where fully capitated HMOs (no different from the managed care ""plans,"" proposed in the current waiver). Our research team did careful work comparing cost increases in Mecklenburg country with cost increases in New Hanover County in the far eastern part of the state & the second most densely populated country where traditional unmanaged Medicaid still existed. (That plan is a far cry from the current Medicaid managed care program (CCNC) that uses primary care case management (PCCM).) A rigorous difference-in-difference analysis showed (to our surprise) that the HMOs in Mecklenburg were not controlling health care cost increases any better than the traditional, non-managed care program in the East. {Schoeps, NB, WB Bandon, & RV Chaudry, ""Medicaid Expenditures under Risk-Contracting HMOs and Traditional Fee for Service: A comparison of Two North Carolina Counties,"" in MANAGED CARE PROGRAMS edited by M. Ito & Y. Nakajima (New York: Nova Science Publishers, 2008): pp. 1-26.]

Using CAHPS surveys in 2000 we compared the early version of CCNCs with the Medicaid population enrolled in HMOs in Mecklenburg county. As a result of a collaboration with Paul Cleary at Harvard & Joe Thompson in AR, we were able to oversample children with special needs. Our large survey showed no statistical difference between the two populations (both children & adults) enrolled in the 2 delivery systems in question after question dealing with access, satisfaction & utilization. But we did notice that the almost universal pattern was that those enrolled in the CCNC prototype registered as more favorable--only with a large sample size the difference was almost never statistically significant.

The take home from our 20 years of empirical work is that the current CCNC system, which is now firmly established with its wide physician acceptance across the state, is doing well in the parameters that matter to patients. Why start a new system with all the disruptions that building new delivery systems if bound to bring? The process in 1996-97 in Mecklenburg County was slow & expensive.) The wide physician acceptance of CCNC makes it an ideal base to efficiently expand Medicaid.",217073,20 Jul 2016 21:47:04
"CMS- Please say no and protect the children of NC and the taxpayers of America.
This is a disaster- it is simply impossible for 15 different MCOs to be cheaper than a single payer Medicaid system with nationally recognized CCNC care mgt.

Sure 40 other states have MCOcaid- and it is more expensive and more difficult to care for children. Stop testing this failed hypothesis that private companies can save money in the medicaid population.",217077,20 Jul 2016 21:58:09
"Please expand health access to include the unfortunate 500,000 members of our NC population who fall into the gap between Medicaid eligibility and ACA subsidies.

"I urge you to consider these comments to support Medicaid Expansion in North Carolina as a condition for any degree of approval for North Carolina's Medicaid Reform Waiver application.

Until one sits across the table from a low-income consumer seeking health insurance — as I have as a ACA Navigator — and must deliver the unimaginable line, ""I'm sorry, but with income under $11,770, you do not qualify for coverage under The Affordable Care Act,"" one cannot feel the profound sorrow.  I have faced their pain, anguish, disbelief, fear.  ""How can my government do this to me?"" they wonder.  (I might add that ""my government"" is presumed by most to be the Federal Government, inasmuch as the ACA was an act of Congress and the CMS administers these regulations.)  

I stand in support of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, and I have observed with satisfaction the Marketplace process and the outcome improvements since OE1. No actions to ""reform"" Medicaid can compensate for the fact that hundreds of thousands of North Carolinians currently have no access to Medicaid at all.

As I am unable to attach a file, I will submit another comment immediately in further testimony for the many reasons why North Carolina Medicaid Expansion is so critical. Thank you.

"Friends,
As Georgetown University's ""MEDICAID EXPANSION'S IMPACT ON HOSPITALS AND CLINICS"" research shows huge problems in non-expansion states, my medical practitioner friends report that they continue to see a great many uninsured patients in Buncombe County NC.  Of course this is much truer for those who are ""charity care"" or safety net providers.  And yet, so many, who are uninsured, will not attend to their health at all, putting themselves and the community at risk.
North Carolina has already begun to face loss of hospitals in part due to the reduction in uncompensated care funding.  Four are gone now in rural areas where proximity matters.  Our own Mission Hospital will survive, but it, too, is losing — and our insurance rates in NC are climbing, as hospitals seek to recover lost dollars from insured patients.  The EMS drivers who spoke at the Medicaid Reform hearing in Asheville in April emphasized that they, too, suffer the reduction in this funding, hampering their service and threatening their sustainability.  
The economic impact of Non-Expansion in North Carolina goes beyond the medical community.  In our state, over $6 billion in federal funding has been lost in 2014 and 2015, since the implementation of the ACA Marketplace in 2013-14.  Without expansion between 2016 and 2020, estimates suggest a loss of an additional $21 billion in federal funding.  
More than 43,000 jobs —  both within and beyond the health care industry -- might have been created by 2020 had NC expanded Medicaid— but that has not happened. (Cone Health Foundation Report)  This is to say nothing of the loss of tax revenue that accompanies those jobs.  The best estimates suggest that a half million people in NC would be covered under expanded Medicaid.  About three-fourths (or about 375,000) of that number will otherwise continue to be uninsured, even though the majority of them have jobs. (Wake Forest University, Health Law & Policy Program)   Small business is the most vibrant part of the economy in Asheville, my home, and yet with creative start-ups, wages are often lower, benefits are few, and part-time and seasonal workers abound. Without the saving-grace assistance of the Affordable Care Act for low income workers, both entrepreneurs and employees are penalized, and we all lose.  
Importantly, 1000 people die each year who might have accessed care through Expanded Medicaid. Please act to require Expansion now. Thank you. Catherine Schaller",217093,20 Jul 2016 22:52:41
